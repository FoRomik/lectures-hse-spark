I bought this car charger expecting a similar quality device. Unfortunately, my charger arrived DOA. I contacted Anker customer support, and after a short e-mail exchange, they agreed to send me a replacement immediately without requiring me to send them back the defective unit. The new charger arrived via USPS 4 days later and works perfectly. I'd give Anker 5 stars for customer support--getting a replacement was no hassle at all. Every company deals with defective units; that's simply the reality of selling electronics. However, NOT every company has quick, friendly customer service. That alone makes me more likely to buy products from Anker in the future.The charger itself works flawlessly now that I have a working unit. It charges my Android phone twice as fast as my old car charger which barely kept up with the battery drain of running Google Maps. This charger will allow me to use the GPS and Google Maps AND charges my phone while doing so.The design is simple, elegant, and solid. No creaking plastic, no rough edges, no &#34;cheap&#34; feel to any aspect of the charger. I'm very happy with my working unit. Since I got a defective one the first time, I'll post updates to this review in the future so that I can comment on the longevity of the charger.Anker customer service = 5 starsCharger = 5 StarsTotal = 10 Stars?Either way, this is a bargain and well worth the purchase price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Anker Customer Service Experience + Review", "unixReviewTime": 1389484800, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2014"}

Don't worry about that.The OtterBox is definitely a great case, but this \"mid-grade\" Otterbox (Commuter series) seems extremely similar to the iBlason which is 1/4th the price.OtterBox comes with a screen protector which is nice (probably a $3 value), and the hole to access to stylus is a little better on the OtterBox.The iBlason has much more protection on the corners (bump guards), which makes me feel it has better drop protection, but it also makes it a bit more difficult to slide in & out of your pocket.The OtterBox also has a slightly sturdier backing to it. Also, I think the OtterBox tries to leave a small cushion of air between the case and the phone, for extra protection, kindof like bubble wrap.I think the OtterBox is slightly better quality overall than the iBlason, though the iBlason has the corner bump guards which are definitely more protection. I give them both 4.5 or 5 stars, but I'm marking the Otterbox down just due to price. The higher models are probably worth $40-$50, but the Commuter should really be closer to $20-$25.If you feel you need moderate protection for your phone (an occasional mishap or drop), I would probably recommend the ~much~ cheaper iBlason. Personally, I'm keeping the iBlason and giving the OtterBox to my wife.However, if you drop your phone daily, have an extreme work environment, or are really really rough on your phone, get the Defender series for about the same price.

I compared this to other cases, and it's much slimmer. The whole deal with the iPhone 5/5S is how thin it is, and this case accentuates that. It's as thin as it can be and still provide protection. Major kudos for that.2) With the phone in it, the case feels very natural in your hand. The sleek polished back and sides give this a great feel. All the buttons and cut-outs are in exactly the right places. It's very snug and a perfect fit.So I was pleasantly surprised -- the phone feels great in this case.

The 5V or \"Voltage\" listed there is a USB standard, but it's the second number you want to pay particular attention to: the Amperage, signified as A or mA (milliAmp). With all other things being equal, the higher the Amperage - the faster the charge.The rub is the charger doesn't decide how much electricity to send, but rather the device itself that PULLS electricity from the AC plug or USB port. All Android-based devices will limit the energy draw to a maximum of about 500mA (or  of a full Amp) when connected to a USB port. Most aftermarket chargers follow the USB data standard that includes 4 \"pins\" within a connector - 2 for power-charging and 2 for data-transfer (meaning your device recognizes it as a USB port); whereas most OEM chargers usually have the data pins \"shorted\" so the device sees only charging pins, thus indicating a power-charger and allowing itself to draw the maximum current. It's fairly complicated and counter-intuitive at first, and it took me a long time to find out why my devices were charging so slowly on a supposedly fast after-market charger. This is demonstrable by the very chargers Amazon itself sells... theAmazon Kindle 9W PowerFast Adaptercosts more - but you'll only get up to 1.8A output no matter which cable used since they have effectively killed the data pins on the charger; whereas they also sell the better valueAmazonBasics Wall Charger with USB Outlet (2.1 Amp Output)with its higher output, but it has all 4 USB pins intact - so unless you have a specialized charging-only cable the most you will ever draw at any time from it is around 500mA. You absolutely need a good charging-only cable to take advantage of the faster speed provided by the higher output of most aftermarket chargers.With this particular Samsung OEM charger you don't have to worry about getting any specialized cables, you will always get 700mA (0.7A)... that's just not terribly fast compared to other chargers on the market. I prefer a charger to give at least 2.1A, and my favorite does 3.0A - but most of them have to be used with a specific, Charging-Only cables (See Below).If you have purchased a different aftermarket charger and wondered why it didn't seem to juice your device very fast, or just doesn't seem to be living up to its full potential - thePortaPow Specialised 5ft 24AWG Charge Only Micro USB Cable for Blackberry, Xperia, HTC One, Google Nexus, Other Fast Charging Devicesis likely all you need to increase the power flow. If you don't already have a verified charging-only cable now or don't own a charger that has output of more than 700mA, I can tell you that your best bet is to purchase theAmazonBasics Wall Charger (2.1 Amp Output)in combination with thePortaPow Charge-Only Micro-USB Cable. This will give you a full charging speed of 2.1A, and you will simply be amazed how fast your device charges. There is no harm to the device because the phone or tablet will only draw as much as it can handle.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "OEM Charger that just doesn't go fast enough", "unixReviewTime": 1388880000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2014"}

I was able to charge all four devices on one charge of the PowerPak with some charge remaining (1 light). It took around 5-6 hours to bring the PowerPak back to a full charge (4 lights), which seems very reasonable. Although I did not have the opportunity during the evaluation period to use the PowerPak under outdoor conditions, the design is very robust and when the access door is closed, it appears to be water tight. I would not hesitate to use it outdoors under inclimate conditions, providing I could keep the USB ports themselves from direct contact with rain or water submersion.I found it very useful to have one of the USB ports designed to charge mobile phones and the other rated at a higher capacity for tablets, especially iPads. They are clearly labeled on the access panel as 5V1A and 5V2.1A so there is no confusion on which one to use. The smaller port to recharge the PowerPak is also in the same area, protected by the access door. The PowerPak Xtreme is ideal for use in any situation which requires spending significant time outdoor away from easily accessible power sources. This would include any type of work in the field such as construction sites, oil fields and similar environments, as well as camping, fishing and hunting trips. This would also be useful on long car, bus or plane trips where access to USB power sources may be limited, although the less rugged New Trent iCarrier IMP120D battery is a bit lighter and ideal in those environments.I rate the New Trent PowerPak Xtreme a 5 out of 5 stars based on my use so far.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "New Trent PowerPak Provides Extended Life for Portable Electronics in the Field", "unixReviewTime": 1386115200, "reviewTime": "12 4, 2013"}

They are ease to pair, the battery is long lasting, and they are really small so you can bring it with you everywhere you go.Having different brands of Bluetooth speaker under $100 I can classify them in following order:1) Braven 570  - The best sound in the list, open and clear with tight bass and soft treble, the mids are clear and very smooth. You have volume controls, hands free and a USB port to charge your phone in an emergency. Since the controls are in the right side of the speaker you have to get the speaker in your hands to use them. The Bluetooth range is great (30 feet). Price: around $100.2) LePow's Modre -  Good sound, lack a bit of treble and bass, is very portable and has good construction. The only control available is the on/off at the speaker's bottom, you have to use your phone for volume and start hands free. The Bluetooth range is great (30 feet).  Price: around $ 30.3) GoGroove BlueSYNC SRC - The sound is ok, but a little harsh in the treble and lacks some bass.  Easy to pair, the controls works flawless and they are positioned on the speaker top, so they are very easy to access and to use. Price: around $304) Pyle PWPBT60 - The sound is ok, a lot of bass, but the mids and trebles are muffled. Lacks certain openness to the sound. They are sturdy, heavy, but have the worst Bluetooth connection. The connection drops all the time when someone or something is placed between the speaker and the phone, very annoying. The Bluetooth range is very limited. Price: around $70If you want a good sounding speaker that you can carry with you everywhere and don't want spend a lot of money, LePow's is the way to go.

GSM phones (like AT&T;, T-Mobile, and most overseas carriers) use a &#34;SIM&#34; card.  For a while, SIM cards came in one size, and that fit any phone.  However, as phones started to get more and more sophisticated and manufacturers scrambled to fit more inside the device, the SIM card was targeted for size reduction.  First came the Micro-SIM, which is still popular and in use today in many devices (such as the Samsung Galaxy S4).  Then came the Nano-SIM, which is even smaller, and is used in the GSM version of the Apple iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S.But here's the trick... aside from the size of the SIM, all three SIM cards are exactly the same.  In other words, you can take a big SIM and cut it down into a micro or nano SIM size.  The chip in the middle of the card doesn't get damaged and doesn't know or care how much plastic is around it.I purchased this because I wanted to cut my AT&T; Micro-SIM card down to Nano-SIM size for an iPhone 5, but still have the option to use the Nano-SIM in the Galaxy S4 by using an adapter.First, I didn't bother using the cut-down stickers that came with this product.  I just wasn't confident enough that I could make the precise cuts without damaging the data chip part of the SIM card.  Additionally, using stickers gives you only one chance to cut a SIM down.  Once you destroy the sticker, it can't be used again.The size-up adapters are functional but not perfect.  There are three adapters... nano-to-micro, nano-to-full-size, and micro-to-full-size.  Each size-up adapter has a cutout where you can put the smaller SIM so that you can use it in a larger slot.  The cutout has a clear plastic film in one side to keep it in place.  Unfortunately, I found that the extra thickness from the extra film made it hard to insert the adapter into a phone.  Also, it is very hard to keep the smaller SIM in the cutout, because the film has to be on the back side of the SIM.  Many phones require you to insert the SIM card face-down.  If you use these adapters, the smaller SIM falls out of the cutout when you flip the adapter over.  Additionally, I found that the smaller SIM would often fall out of the adapter as I tried to slide it in.  I can't recommend these SIM adapters, as they are very difficult to use.  I recommend using the &#34;snap-in&#34; type SIM adapters.  They don't add thickness to the SIM and they secure the smaller SIM in the adapter while it is in use.Overall, I don't think this is a good quality product.  In a pinch, it will work.  But there are better-working alternatives available on Amazon.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "There are better options", "unixReviewTime": 1382313600, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2013"}

It provides a decent amount of protection because the lips slightly raised, but sides are completely exposed.

After trying all three, I quickly decided that the protection of this (slightly) bulkier case made it my choice. The design is good, and I like the polycarbonate shell inset. I also liked how it added a level of grip that the other cases did not (and the phone itself doesn't really, either).I used this case on my Nexus for around 2 weeks, and then started noticing that the polycarbonate shell was not fitting in the inset as well as it had at the start. For someone who is finicky about the fit and finish of things, this didn't sit well with me. It was as if the rubber part of the case fit exactly right, but the shell was slightly too large - it bowed out just a little from the rest of the case. When I ran my finger along the back of the phone, it would catch on the shell. It's only a couple of millimeters, probably, but it was enough that it bothered me.I tried removing the shell and bending it JUST slightly in the opposite direction, I even thought about gluing it, but I don't believe glue would hold it.  So ultimately, I switched to one of the other cases. As much as I like the design and extra protection of the Spigen Slim Armor case, the end result is I'm not using it on my phone.  If they can figure out a way to resolve that problem, I'd switch back to it in a heartbeat. So, if you aren't bothered by slight issues like that, I'd highly recommend this case.

The review represents my unbiased opinion.The size of this battery pack was just slightly bigger than my iphone 4s. I can get about 4 charges for my iphone, give or take, on par with what I would expect for the battery. The benefit of this device is that it is a solar charger, giving you an opportunity to use it away from a power source.Charging time and ports: charging time took only a few hours for a complete charge from a wall source. The LED indicator lights showed the charge status on a 4 light system. There are 2 ports on this device, a 1 amp and a 2 amp, perfect for smartphones and ipad. To charge the device, any standard micro usb charger would work.Solar Panel Feature: The solar panel is on one side of the battery pack. When the solar panel is charging, the lights will turn on and indicate so. In my test, I had the solar charger charging for a day, in my car, where it would theoretically get plenty of sunlight. However, the 2nd day became quite cloudy. However, the solar panel still indicated it was charging. Basically, whenever there is sufficient light, the battery will charge itself through the solar panel. The lights will flash, followed by the &#8220;status&#8221; of the charging of the battery pack.After 1 cloudy day of charging, it charged my iphone 3%. As other reviewers have noted, it&#8217;s going to be difficult to charge the battery pack fully from the solar panel alone. However, this would be a great opportunity to gain free energy. Leave it in a window or what not for a week or so, and you should be able to charge your phone. The solar panel is a great idea. It would be useful for teaching kids about harvesting energy from the sun, or just harvesting free energy whenever you can. It&#8217;s a nice secondary feature to the battery pack. While I didn&#8217;t try it, I can see this solar battery pack working well as a night light. Charging up during the day (while you&#8217;re out camping or what not and hiking) and using it to provide power to an led usb light for some light at night, at camping or what not.Design: The best thing about this battery pack would be the solar option. It would be that it is possible to get some charge when there is no other option available. All the power buttons and ports are on one of the short edges. This gives the ability to put the battery pack in a small area (like a pocket) and have all the cables and control and indicators on one side for easy review. The basic outline is charging port, power button, LED indicator lights, charging port from wall, and charging port. The color of the device is black with a white border around the edge. You can polish and keep the solar panel clean with the wipe cloth that&#8217;s included in the package.Weight: The weight of the device is no heavier than any other similar 8000 mah battery pack device. The solar panel really doesn&#8217;t add much weight, but adds a nice, unique feature to the battery pack.Extras: The battery comes with a small carrying case, tips for the USB connector. It has 4 tips with 1 wire. The tips interchange (30 pin, the new iphone 5 connector lightning, micro usb and mini usb). Definitely convenient to carry 1 wire for so many heads to charge. It also comes with a carrying case.Highlights for this battery pack include the two available charging ports, solar panel, and the included cable for maximum devices you can charge.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Sunny Idea", "unixReviewTime": 1401062400, "reviewTime": "05 26, 2014"}

I got tired of Apple's &#34;50 shades of grey&#34; upgrade in IOS7, and so had my Verizon rep for my corporate account send me the Lumia 928 back in September of 2013.  I loved it, and would've ordered one right there until I saw a leaked photo and some tentative specs of the Lumia 929 that was to be released in a couple months.  I decided to wait, since the improvements over the 928 were many.I almost lost patience in November, December, and January when all the rumored release dates passed, but I'm glad I waited.  My rep was able to overnight one to me so I had it on release day.  I gave my old iPhone 5 to one of my employees and never looked back.This is a VERY nice phone in all respects.  In every way I compare it to my iPhone 5, it wins.  The only downside is the thin choice of apps still in the Microsoft store, but that's improving.  The iPhone and Samsung phones started out the same way.  The only things I really miss from the iPhone are a few apps, not the phone itself, since I have a lot of home automation, and there is, as yet, no Windows phone options for my Logitech security cameras, my Ecobee thermostat, and a few of my power switch modules.But apps aside, from a hardware perspective, this is a clear win.  The full 1920x1080 screen is gorgeous to view.  Even in sunlight I can see what I need to see.  I was a little worried about the size for two reasons - first, I didn't want something that was awkward to hold.  I've seen people with the &#34;phablet&#34; devices and I just can't picture lugging something like that around as a PHONE - may as well use my retina iPad mini...  But I also just bought a new 2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited, and the technology package in it has a special upper section of the arm rest that includes a Qi charging plate and a little sliding holder to keep the phone there.  I really hoped this would fit in there ,and it did, even with a case on.  Snug, but it works great.  And the increase in resolution over the 928 means that there's more tiles I can fit on the main screen.And for me, that's where the iPhone loses compared to Windows.  I never cared much for the lock screen's lack of information, which was why I invariable jailbroke my iPhones.  And the limited options for the screens when the phone was unlocked made it annoying to have to dig into folders to find what I was looking for, or swipe the screen.  I was very happy when they made folders an option, so you didn't have 20 or 30 pages of icons, but it still was annoying sometimes.  I like that with Windows I can resize the icons and fit  lot of things that I use daily on a single screen.  I also love the live tile implementation of things, so I can see at a glance what's been happening without having to rely on a notification center type of screen.It's easy to hold, since in reality it isn't THAT much larger than the iPhone 5 was.  The buttons are easy to get at and responsive.  I like that they changed the USB port to the bottom, since the 928 had it on the top and that just drove me bonkers during my week of testing.  The sound is quite good for such a small device.The processor is snappy, which makes sense since it's the quad core snapdragon processor.  There's little to no waiting for pretty much anything I open on here.  Graphics are incredible and smooth for the few games I've put on here so far.  Zooming photos or the camera is also very smooth.And the camera - it's amazing.  I have several higher end digital cameras, and an awesome $1600 Sony camcorder, but the photos this turns out are more than acceptable to me.  It used to be I'd &#34;settle&#34; for photos with my iPhone due to convenience, when I didn't want to lug my large camera case around with the cameras and lenses for some event.  And yes, if I really want to capture something to the best of my ability, I'll use my real photo equipment.  However, for the other 95% of the time, I'll be more than happy to use my phone now and not have to carry anything else out.  The options are easy to get at, white balance, ISO, flash, so many more options that with the iPhone...  And the single finger zoom, rather than the pinch, or the slider at the one spot on the iPhone, makes bracketing my pictures so much easier.  I find I can get just the shot I want so much easier with this than I could with the iPhone, and the quality, needless to say, just doesn't compare.  The 20 mp camera here and the optics used make you think that there was no way this photo could've been taken by a phone.We have a client in a medical building that's on the lower floor, and in their server room, we NEVER have gotten a signal with any phone from any carrier.  And yesterday I was able to receive a phone call in there, and hear and be heard.  That was a first for our company in that site.  Another pleasure for the phone is being able to hit &#34;END&#34; and have it end the call.  I've spent most of my time after the IOS 7 update on my iPhone being unable to end a call myself, it would not respond to me pressing &#34;END&#34; no matter how many times I tried.  Phone calls would only end when the other side hung up and my phone realized it.I love the built in Qi charger.  I had a Duracell case for my iPhone and another extended battery that charged on a proprietary pad, and had gotten used to that method of charging.  So I bought two charging pads, one for the office, one for home.  I've gone through three cases so far trying to find a good one, and the charging on the pads and even in my Jeep works through the cases just fine.  It's a convenience that you don't realize you'd use until you get accustomed to it.  No plugs, no cables, just set the phone down and the charging begins, with no special case required like the iPhone.  The back gets a little warm, but I've never felt it get hot no matter how long I had it placed on the charger.This has quite a large battery in it, and initially I thought it'd last longer than the iPhone, but the downside to the live tiles is battery consumption.  With little talking and little game playing, it runs down quicker than you'd think.  I went from 100% at 7 AM at a client site to about 40% left after 8 hours. There's a lot of forum posts out there about things you can do to lessen the impact, but for me I'd rather deal with the battery consumption and have all my data, since this is first and foremost a business tool for me.  Each mail account has its own live tile so I can see at a glance what the status is of new messages for my own Exchange server, or Gmail, or my Windows Live account.  I'm not much of a facebook user but it's there as well, keeping me updated on info for my family.  All of this visible without opening any programs up.  For me, that convenience makes up for the battery being used quicker.Another bonus for me is with my Jeep.  I have the large Uconnect system, that can let you do voice texting over the stereo system.  This never worked with my iPhone, but it works fine with the Icon.  It reads me a text, and I can voice back what my reply is, and the car will repeat what I said and give me the opportunity to accept what it heard, or change it.  Very handy since I don't pull up the phone to send or receive texts and such while driving.  Another thing I don't use much, but it's nice to have when I need to.For me, the lack of an expansion slot for an SD card or something isn't an issue.  I have a Lenovo Helix tablet / laptop that I use for all my data.  I pull photos to it from my Onedrive (used to be Microsoft's Skydrive) so I really don't have a need for extra storage on the phone.  But for some people who use a phone as their center of their digital existence, it will be a major issue.  So if you absolutely must have additional storage on the device, this may not be for you.  But with the the seamless cloud storage integration, I don't think it's that critical for a lot of people.And I like that I have such a viable option for Microsoft Office documents here, that I can open a Word document from my Onedrive and it looks like I expect it to, and that I can edit it and then have the results later on my computer when I'm back at the office.All in all, I'm 100% happy with the hardware, just a little impatient with developers of the programs I need for home automation to make a Windows Phone variant of their software.  There's nothing I feel I lost in my transition from the iPhone, I've only gained.  For me, this is a much more usable phone in all respects than my iPhones ever were.  And it's a big step from the old Windows Mobile phones back in 2007 and 2008.This is one phone that shows that the Windows Phone platform isn't just a fluke, and it has all the opportunities to flourish.  Of course, that success isn't in Microsoft's hands, but in the hands of the people who write apps.  It doesn't matter how awesome a phone is, if people can't get the things they want or need to run on it, most of them will stick with the platform that they can.  So I really hope the Microsoft store starts fleshing itself out.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great upgrade from my iPhone 5", "unixReviewTime": 1393632000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2014"}

The FM transmitter is strong enough for clear reception by my rear antenna, which was not true for my previous FM transmitter.  With my Motorola Droid, free Pandora radio, and the Motorokr, its like having free satellite radio in the car.  Some of the Motorkr features are especially useful, like searching for the bext FM frequency and announcing it, as well as simple phone controls on the front of the unit.  For me I just need to plug it in to the car adapter for about 1 hour and it will run on batteries all week.  The only issue I have is that it occasionally shuts off FM transmission and/or Bluetooth by design - I would like the option for Bluetooth and FM to remain ON when I am not streaming music or using the phone, so I can receive a call and listen on FM at any time (note I can still listen via the adequate Motorokr built-in speaker).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "BEST Solution for Phone/MP3 Bluetooth in Your Car", "unixReviewTime": 1271808000, "reviewTime": "04 21, 2010"}

The sales people there were very helpful, and we looked through all the cases they had in stock.  For some reason, they carried Griffin Survivor for the iPod, but they didn't have this version.  But the guy who was helping me suggested that this was my best bet (God bless people who don't work on commission!).  I mean, they had some serious waterproof cases (like, for underwater use) - but those were not functional for everyday use.So we looked up the Griffin Survivor case right there in the Apple store, and I added it to my cart.It meant a lot to me that the guy who lives and breathes iPhones all day long thinks that THIS is the best case to get for decent water/damage protection while still being functional.  That's about the best endorsement you can get.I received my case and it was an effort just to get it out of the carboard box it came in.  As I took it apart, I had to keep track of how it came apart so I could put it back together.  There are 4 pieces, of which 3 are necessary for protection.  There are two pieces that snap around the iPhone to form the first layer of hard casing, then there's the big rubber piece that this hard case fits into.  To get water/shock protection, you do need the big rubber piece, for sure.  Because the speakers/ports etc are all otherwise exposed.  The fourth piece is the belt clip, which is not necessaryThe rubber case covers all the water susceptible parts of the phone.  You can still access them all because there are flaps that move away of you want to charge the phone or use the video camera or headphone jack.  However, know that this is NOT water proof.  You cannot submerse it.  I doubt it would survive a drop into the toilet (maybe if you fished it out VERY quickly it would be ok).  But a fall into a wet sink or use in the rain or being in the same handbag as a leaky water bottle - I'm pretty sure this would stand up really well.  And I definitely feel like I could drop this without damage.Size-wise, this will make your iphone about the size of a non-stuffed men's wallet.  You can stick it in a pants pocket, but it would look weird in a shirt pocket, which you probably can do just fine if it weren't in a case.  Look, the case definitely adds bulk.  But I think it's manageable.Anyway, in sum, I am very happy with this purchase.  I am glad that the guy at the Apple store made this recommendation.  That was really ALL I needed to be sure, and now that I have it I know it was the right choice too.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Apple Store Recommeded", "unixReviewTime": 1331769600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2012"}

While you don't have to apply a whole lot of pressure, just a light touch of the stylus may not work, so keep this in mind.

However, the colorful finish can be scratched easily with sharp objects.Using a stylus helps keep fingerprints off your device, which is a nice benefit.These styli do have a plastic clip, however.

You simply can't get a better fitting case for PROTECTION.2) You just invested in a $700 or more smartphone/tablet/device that can do anything and more than most desktops found in many homes across the planet.  Why would you not invest a few bucks into PROTECTING your investment?  It takes one simple drop to chip the sides or paint not to mention that the front case could crack.  Yes, there are plans now that allow you to replace your phone, but why go through the hassle of starting new again.3) Yes, the plastic screen protection that comes with it is not that great, but if you have owned an Otterbox before you know the deal.  Peel that one off, invest in a real screen protection film or better yet, get a Tempered Glass Protection screen.4) And as everyone who has owned an Otterbox before knows, the hard clip case is either useless and you never really carry it or you are someone who carries their phone on your hip all the time.  I myself, do not.5) The rubber grip is just enough to be able to shove the phone in your back pocket without too much trouble and yet it has enough grip that it doesn't jump out of your hand while using it one handed.All in all, an excellent case.

It used a cradle that you had to open/close and adjust every time you wanted to remove your phone.  The CD slot mount was great, but cradle, well not so much.  Then I saw this product that used a magnet to hold the phone, it looked so sleek compared to the cradle model from competitor M.  The price was right at 20 bucks so I threw caution to the wind and purchased this InfiniApps Slyde CD mount.Received it quickly (love Amazon Prime), and found it easy to install (pictures and video's can be found easily so I won't go into the details), it's just simple!  While driving with it I noticed that it had a little \"jiggle\" to it.  Not terrible, but definitely noticeable and this is not typical of what I had experience with similar CD slot mount from competitor M.Here's where it gets good....  Even before I had a chance to let them know of the problem InfiniApps reached out to me first.  They sent a message through Amazon letting me know they had a new version of Slyde CD mount that would mitigate the problem customers might experience when their phone is mounted.  They also let me know they were going to ship the newer model to me FREE OF CHARGE.  That totally blew me away that they would be proactive to let me know they were aware of the problem, that they had a new model that fixed the problem and that they shipped it to me promptly at no cost.I've received the new mount and see that the replacement has a very slight change to the neck of the mount.  It's a bit beefier, just a bit, but it appears to make a huge difference.  Took a ride and the \"jiggle\" is gone.I have to say I really like the InfiniApps Slyde CD mount, it's very easy to install and even easier to use.  I just jump into my vehicle and in a matter of a second my phone is securely mounted (and now without any \"jiggle\").  I have a Razr Maxx HD with a Incipio Feather case.  I put the metal plate between my phone and case (didn't bother to use the sticky tape) and the phone holds securely.  It stays as I attach it, in portrait or landscape mode.

It only sticks out of your car's charging outlet about 1 inch.&#9830; Has three ports for a total of 5.4A output (a 2.4A Tablet port, a 1.5A Apple port and a 1.5A Android port).&#9830; Fast charging speeds for charging two devices concurrently, including an iPad.&#9830; Very compact for travel if you need to take a car charger with you on trips (renting a car at your destination for example).Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in tiny cardboard box with only a small sticker on it, no wasted packaging here.  Inside the box was the charger and a small instruction manual.  You see right away that this charger is surprisingly small for such a powerful 3-Port charger. It is the smallest one I've seen with these kind of specs.  It has three USB ports on the front, a 2.4A Tablet port, a 1.5A Apple port and a 1.5A Android port for a total of 5.4A output. It appears to have a very nice build quality.&#9830; Installation - As with any car charger, you basically just plug the unit into you car's charging outlet. Once plugged in, I noticed that the spring pushed back a little, but not enough to make it fall it.  Once in, the fit was pretty snug and secure.  No problems.  This charger makes most other 3-Port chargers look giant. My Pathfinder's charging outlets are on the side of the passenger area where a knee can easily bump the charger. This much smaller charger gives the passenger a little more leg room in my vehicle.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once installed, I did some basic tests to see how the Bolse car charger handles various charging situations. During my work commute, I took my iPhone 5 that had 48% charge remaining and I did a stand alone test using all ports for 5 minutes each.  The results are as follows:In the 2.4A Tablet port for 5 minutes increased the charge to 53%, or +5%.In the 1.5A Apple port for 5 minutes increased the charge to 58%, or +5%.In the 1.5A Android port for 5 minutes increased the charge to 63%, or +5%.Back in the 1.5A Apple port for 5 minutes increased the charge to 68%, or +5%.All ports worked great with my iPhone 5 and increased the charge on my phone by 1% per minute, which is right on par with most other chargers that I have tested.  I then plugged in my iPad 2 in the 2.4A Tablet port and it charged up just fine with my iPhone still in the 1.5A Apple port.  Individual and simultaneous charging tests were great.  I also plugged in my Bluetooth Music Receiver into the third port just for good measure with no problems.  For my situation, this was great with having several devices in my car on a regular basis.Conclusion:Overall, this is an amazing 3-Port Car Charger with really high power and great charging results.  It is really tiny and works great for multiple device vehicles.  At the time of this review, the price was $12.99 which really can't be beat with these kind of specs.

Its charging up for the first time just now and its taking awhile which i assume it would. The plastics aren't quite Otterbox quality but it works great with this case given the rubberized TPU shell is sturdy, so once assembled i don't notice a difference, just a solid case with a killer battery. This is my first Zero Lemon product and i must say the quality of the items received along with the cost is amazing. Ive come just to expect an Otterbox case alone at the cost of 59.99, and now for the same cost i get a 10,000 mah battery with it, outstanding value.I cannot comment on the battery life as it is charging for the first time and will probably not be back to update the review unless their is a problem but here's my initial thoughts. I also own the 6400 mah Hyperion battery and was getting 2 days of usage from that battery, so dump another 3600 mah on top of that and i would expect at least another day or day and a half. Thrilled with the possibilities, so just time to wait and see after a few factory suggested break in / charge cycles.The only gripe i have is shipping. I wish Bastex Wireless would dump DHL Global Mail and consider other options. They must do a ton of bulk shipping especially since this is the first batch of 500, so that's 500 packages right there alone. Not sure if this is even realistic but the wait time with DHL on the lowest shipping option was pretty long at 7 days to move from Texas to St. Louis. It sat in STL ready for transport to USPS for 3 business days before it just this morning appeared at my local USPS facility for delivery. Iv'e seen other reviewers also knock this company you do business with, and i would hate for them to reflect poorly on your business, which produces an outstanding product. Next time i will choose expedited for 9.99 i believe, which may make shipping a little less of a headache for someone impatient like myself.Im 110% happy so far with my purchase, and Bastex Wireless does a great job with communication on Zero Lemons Facebook page given how many gripes and irritated customers there appear to be, which i saw basically over shipping transit times, or someone misreading that they were allowed to preorder and just because Amazon says shipped doesnt mean it shipped since Bastex had to wait for the product.All that said for $60, and i have the reassurance of a 6 month guarantee against failures...Would for sure do repeat business and urge anyone on the fence to give them a shot.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent product!", "unixReviewTime": 1386633600, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2013"}

I did struggle a bit to get the phone to fit into the soft outer case, since it is quite tight, but once the phone was in, it was a pretty snug fit.

The phone itself is also easy to access and there are no issues or delayed responses while tapping on the phone through the screen protector. One thing that bothered me, the transparent film covering the home button looks and feels a bit flimsy.

But it tells me that the company supports it-Easy to operate dial and buttons, even with thick winter gloves onCons:-It survived a small rain, but there is nowhere written that it is waterproof. All the holes are plugged with rubber cups but in a heavy rain you should probably take it of. If they could make it waterproof with some certificate that would be awesome. Also most bikers don't drive in the rain like I do.-They could put an mp3 player inside it with a micro SD memory slot, but it would be more expensive and some people just don't listen to music while driving.

{"reviewerID": "A2YM85TO0H2JET", "asin": "B001HSMHGO", "reviewerName": "D. Emerson", "helpful": [38, 38], "reviewText": "I'll just list out the aspects of the phone.  More convenient that way.-Touchscreen: Not as responsive nor as user-friendly and intuitive as the iPhone, but definitely usable, stylus (which is provided), and finger-wise. Sharp, bright colors, with an auto-adjust function that works amazingly well, even in bright sunlight. Slightly recessed, so it does collect dust and other debris (which I found surprisingly annoying, since even lint easily picks up from my pocket), but overall, very attractive and usable.-Windows Mobile 6.1: Though there are still some bugs, a marked improvement over the last version.  The one really annoying aspect of the system is still the slow loading time, and the main nagging thing I noted is that there's a HUGE lag after text messaging, after the message informing you that the text was sent.  The system freezes for a good 5-10 seconds, and won't let you do anything during that time frame.  Mostly just annoying, though certainly not a detractor, especially if you don't text a whole lot.-The keyboard: Spacious, despite the compactness, and slightly curved, with an assisted spring mechanism that feel very, very solid.  The one qualm I have is that they keys are nearly flush with the tray, and the top row can be difficult to press, since it's nearly flush beneath the screen.  Other than that, with some use, it's easy to get used to, and doesn't add bulk or awkward feeling to the phone, like some full QWERTY keyboards. The keys are also backlit, which is a nice touch, especially in shadowed or darkened areas.-The keys: There's plenty of softkeys and shortcuts available, and they're very well-suited for the phone.  There's an optical joystick (passing your finger over the surface allows you to scroll without physically pressing the top/bottom keys, or the screen), which also serves as an \"OK\" key.  I really liked that addition to the phone, since I'm not a big trackball fan, and the sensitivity is customizable, since a too sensitive setting can sometimes lead to wrong commands. There's a dedicated panel key, which is somewhat like a home-screen key, since it takes you to the main panel selection every time. There are also dedicated phone keys, a toggle on the side for volume, and a power/sleep button on the top.  They don't detract from the phone, and the only sticking point is that they're sometimes a bit stiff to press.  Other than that, it's a nice, somewhat comforting feeling to have dedicated keys available, unlike the iPhone.-The panels: These have been touted as, and are, really, the main attraction of the phone. They're are an interesting, very positive feature, since they're customizable (you can even move them around, though this has to be done through choosing a panel and editing it, instead of just dragging it across the screen, which would have been much more intuitive), and varied, and give the Windows system a more personal feel. They can be a bit laggy, but they're fun and functional (the fish panel is just amusing, with the ability of the fish to change color, follow the touch, or swim away if pressed), though I've yet to find a use for the Google page, since it always defaults to Internet Explorer, which I don't utilize.-Internet browsing: Pretty snappy and speedy, even on the Edge network.  The area in which I live doesn't support the 3G bands on this particular phone (I have the overseas Xi, while the U.S. will ship the Xia), though bigger cities with the 1900mHz towers do.  I don't use Internet Explorer, since it's still one of the most useless and dated mobile browsers out there.  The phone is shipped with Opera Mobile 9.5 installed, which works similarly to Safari on the iPhone, though thankfully the cut and paste options are available, unlike the iPhone.  (Trust me, after you've given up that option, and then come back to it, you'll really notice the difference.  Why Apple hasn't picked up on that yet, I'll never know...) There is also the option of downloading Skyfire, which works very well, sometimes faster than Opera.  Both platforms support Flash, and display the full-page layout, like you'd see on your PC.  Either way, pretty enjoyable experience there.-Text/Multimedia Messaging: Windows finally incorporated the threaded conversation for text messaging, much like the iPhone did, creating a more \"IM\" feel to conversations, and making it much easier to keep track of specific conversations.  It lags a bit, as mentioned prior, but a great improvement, without a doubt. It also does Multimedia messaging, and for that alone, in some ways, it is worth more than the iPhone, since Apple still refuses to include that basic function.-Camera/Video/Music: The camera is 3.2 MP, a very decent camera, especially considering the phone size.  It includes a flash, and can be adjusted for various speeds, colors, effects, etc.  There is also a video-camera, which records up to 30fps, though only 24fps, I believe, for the American version.  Why the difference, I couldn't say.  The music player is easy to access (it has it's own panel), and there is also a Sony FM radio included, which is a nice touch, and easy to use, though only with the headphones included, since they act as an antennae, apparently.  Still, very decent media package.-Construction: I have the silver finish, which is really just stunning.  It's very has a very durable, solid feel to it, though can be somewhat slippery, and feels very comfortable in the hand.  The size in my opinion is perfect, compact and sleek, and though this means smaller screen size and somewhat cramped keys, it's really my favorite aspect of the phone.  Has the old, comfortable handset feel of a Nokia candybar phone, actually. Sony really put a lot of thought and effort into it, and it shows.-Other features:  The 3.5mm headphone jack is WONDERFUL.  I had a Sony a few years back, and the one sticking point that kept me from using it as a full-time MP3 player was the fact that I was supposed to use Sony's headphones.  The fact that Sony has branched out, and incorporated the headphone jack, along with the capabilities for a Micro SD card slot (located on the side, when you remove the back cover), really shows that they're creating a platform which is more friendly to users who branch between companies. (Sony usually has their own M2 storage card, which is more pricey than the Micro SD.) Whether it lasts or not depends on their continued association with HTC, I suppose, who designed and helped create the physical phone. I suspect that if they next phone doesn't run Windows Mobile (which has been rumored), those features might disappear. Oh well.  The fact that they're included on the Xperia is really a very nice, convenient touch. The phone also connected with the network very easily, loaded all the information, and formatted the phone, without any heavy programming from me, which was awesome.Overall?  Fantastic phone, with very reliable software, convenient system, sleek and sturdy construction, speedy network connections (even overseas), and plenty of opportunities for personal tweaks and modifications, given the open platform from Windows.  I'd love to give it five stars, instead of the four, but the price was ridiculous, especially considering that it's really just another Windows Mobile smartphone, albeit better-looking and more personal than some others.  Still, it's without a doubt my favorite phone to date, when combining the ease of use and construction appeal.

The cell phone I currently use in this mount is a Google LG Nexus 5, which is encased in a Spigen TPU case. The Mountek mount is very easy to install and remove from the CD player slot in my car. I just push it into the slot, turn the knob a few times, and voila, in seconds the mount is ready to go and stable. The &#34;arms&#34; that encase the phone are spring loaded and open with the touch of the top button with surprising force. Then you just sit your phone in and push the arms shut until it is snugly fit around your phone. The mount is adjustable enough that I could see almost any phone fitting fine in this, even something huge like a Galaxy Note phone. They even thought to put a hole on the bottom plate of the mount, which I can run the charging cable through for my phone and charge it while it is on the mount. I've been using it for months now, and never once had the phone or mount dislodge while in use, so I am happy with it in that regard.The one and only caveat, which is mentioned in many of the other reviews, is that this mount will very quickly cause some permanent warping in the fabric &#34;dust cover&#34; that protects your slot loading disc player in your car. Even after just an hour or two of use, you'll notice some permanent misshaping of the dust cover.

I'm not getting accurate readings on how fast it charges though, because my phone is rooted and have been experiencing issues with battery accuracy, as well as in other places.

It handy to have a pen on the other end; the pen writes very smoothly with little smudging and is easy to handle. The stylus end is soft and should not scratch the screen.Cons: The mesh on the stylus seems to attract some lint from things in the environment (clothing, furniture, etc.) it has only done this a little so far, but it has just been in use for 5 days. It works fairly well for surfing the web or opening and closing files, but does not work as well for games. On solitaire, FreeCell, etc. sometimes one tap is registered as two. On things like angry birds it works less well. Example, bird is released from sling shot before stylus is pulled off the tablet. For fine things such as this your finger works better. I use it on my nook hd+ tablet. This might be just the ticket for a smaller screen where there is little room to swipe your finger. I opened up the pen part to check out ink cartridge (for future replacement) and the clip on the side popped out. I was able to reattach it. The ink cartridge has no printing on it, so it will be hard to know what to replace it with.Room for improvement: have a retractable stylus or a cap to protect the end when not in use. Labeling on ink cartridge to make it easier to replace. Attach clip to the side more firmly. Maybe if there was not as much give on the mesh end it would not be so sensitive? I would rate it 4 out of five stars.

{"reviewerID": "A1O22UA181NUXO", "asin": "B002QEBM96", "reviewerName": "Peter Nguyen", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "I don't understand why so many people are complaining about the firmware. The phone had no problems at all from the beginning when I got the device.I did update the firmware two times (one for each time a firmware was released) and I don't notice any improvements either.Well, based on my experience with the Nokia E90, Touch Pro2, HTC HD2, Apple iPhone 3G, Sony Ericsson Xperia X1, and the Nokia N95, I really think this is the best phone out of all of them.1) Build Quality - The build is alright. There are no wobbly parts (not even the battery cover which people complain about). There is some light leakage on the the upper 'functionality' keys and it is distracting. All Nokia E72's have light leakage here. The Micro SD and USB covers are easily damaged, so you need to be careful when you pry them open. I have not broken these but I can tell that they can snap off easily. But in the end, the build quality on the E72 is very nice and sturdy. The screen also comes with a pre-installed screen protector that can be pealed off.2) Efficiency - This phone does not disappoint in making yourself more productive. The phone is very fast compared to Nokia N95, Nokia E90, and Xperia X1. The back-lighting on the QWERTY keyboard has the perfect brightness. It is much brighter than the Nokia E90's dim keyboard. Because the keyboard lacks a number row and needs larger keys, the Nokia E90 or Touch Pro2 is a better choice if you really need a really good keyboard. However, I was willing to sacrifice the awesome Nokia E90 keyboard to compromise for E72's better features and not-so-bad keyboard. From best to worst, here is how I rank between different keyboards: HTC Touch Pro2 > Nokia E90 > Nokia E72 > HTC HD2 > Apple iPhone > Xperia X1. You will never accidentally turn on your phone and dial numbers when you leave the E72 in your pocket. The phone will never unlock in your pocket (as long as you manually or automatically lock the screen).Most importantly, the Nokia E72 has a better keyboard and better buttons than the E71. There really only is one thing about the E71 keys that are better than the E72 keys. Since the E72 has a mushy optical sensor, using the D-pad isn't fun. The Nokia E71 has a better D-pad (it's more clicky and less mushy). However, the E71 'functionality' buttons are very cramped. I find it two times more efficient pressing the Menu/Calendar/Contacts/Messaging button on the E72 because the buttons are larger and raised. Even the surrounding buttons work well. On the E71 I would press multiple buttons at once. This problem rarely happens on the E72. In terms of the QWERTY keys, the E72 and E71 are very similar. However, the number and Ctrl key on the E72 is larger by comparison. So the E72 wins in terms of keyboard and buttons.3) Battery Efficiency - The brand new battery on the E72 lasts much longer than the all of the phones I've had and used. Furthermore, it is easy to remove and replace, unlike the Nokia E90 and Xperia X1.4) Camera - The camera isn't that good. I still haven't found a phone with a camera that's worth using. From what I can see, I don't think their is much difference between Nokia E72 and Xperia X1's camera. However, the LED flash on the E72 is the pretty good compared to other phone. Of course, I haven't used the camera that much and I am not a camera pro so you can't rely on me in this area.5) Multimedia - the mono speaker on the back of the phone isn't very loud, but it isn't very quiet. It's much louder than the iPhone at max level but much softer than the Nokia E90 (which has amazing stereo speakers). The music player is great, and thanks to the keyboard, I can search through my music library without scrolling. Furthermore, the audio processing on this phone is on par to my laptop. I hear no difference in sound quality between my laptop and my E72 when I use the same headphones. Watching videos on the low-resolution phone is pretty decent and even clear, but because all Nokia comes with a terrible video player, I am disappointed. But thanks to how well a 600 qualcomm CPU performs on Symbian phones, multimedia is very breezy.6) Phone and Organizer - this is an Eseries Nokia device running on symbian. Most Eseries organizer and phone software are same or similar. Well, in my opinion, the Eseries software is better than Windows Mobile and iPhone. Of course one of the main problem with contacts, calendars, and notes on non-touchscreen Nokia's is that you need a good keyboard to be well organized. Well the E72 has a decent keyboard.But in regards other than software, the loudspeaker/speakerphone is very low so conversations will be annoying because it's hard to hear when you are in a noisy environment. Do not get this phone if your priority is to have a good speaker for phone calls in public environments (for music is is decent, especially when you like to hear it in a quiet place).7) Internet - the Wi-Fi browsing on this phone is much faster than the Wi-Fi on my Xperia X1, and E90. I can't comment on other phones. Scrolling through pages on the E90 was a nightmare. This problem is fixed on the E72. It also supports some flash content like you-tube, and for that, it is a very good phone for internet uses. For a non-touch screen phone, it's a good internet device. I actually prefer it over the HTC HD2.8) Price - for 330 U.S. dollars. This phone has the most return to each dollar you spent.If you guys are wondering:A) The accelerometer works with 3rd party software but has pre-installed settings to silent phone calls or alarms.B) The annoying animated-transitions between screens can be disabled in the phone settings.C) Do not buy this phone just because it has a customizable optical D-pad. It's not very good, and the reason I like it is to lock in the 'focus' when I take pictures.D) The Calendar, Contacts, and Messaging keys are completely customizable.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Despite the other bad reviews, I bought this phone and did not regret it", "unixReviewTime": 1275264000, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2010"}

The unit comes with a variety of connections and in addition has a very useful built in mini usb connection which wraps neatly around the body of the charger, and which I was able to use to charge my Blackberry. It should be noted that Apple devices require an Apple cable or adaptor which is not included in the pack.Helpfully the Juice Pack came with a decent charge already so I was able to use it straight away without waiting for the device to charge up. However, charging it up is quite straight forward using any usb power source such as a laptop. Charging to full from empty takes between 6 and 14 hours depending on the power of the source. The pack has four blue lights along its front. When all four are lit it is fully charged, when three are lit it has a 75% charge and so on.The instruction booklet is clearly designed with someone with 20/20 vision in mind as the printing is tiny. However, fortunately using the unit is quite straight forward and one does not need to get a magnifying glass out as it is all fairly intuitive. The instruction booklet does give some examples of how far a full charge in the pack will go. It will charge an IPhone 4 for two to three full charges. Alternatively if used with an Ipad it will supply 55% of a full charge for an Ipad 2 or 35% of a full charge for an Ipad 3 which is still a useful boost if you are short of power.This is a very tidy and attractive little unit, measuring 4 inches by 1.75 inches by 5/8 of an inch and weighing a little over 8 ounces. Hence it is very convenient to carry in a handbag or pocket and with the inbuilt mini usb cable you do not need to carry around cables with you for many devices. I have also looked at the Juice Pack 9000 which carries a 50% greater charge. However, given that one generally uses this sort of unit for an emergency power top up, this will be sufficient for most people's requirements, and the size is certainly more convenient than the larger unit. One feature of the 9000 is that it is also able to recharge two devices simultaneously which may be an advantage for some.Having been caught out with portable devices running out of power, when out and about and with no available plug in, I find this sort of device really useful and certainly something that I tend to carry around with me. It appears to be a robust item. Very Impressive!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Impressive and Conveniently Sized External Power Pack", "unixReviewTime": 1353024000, "reviewTime": "11 16, 2012"}

This film is a soft, very flexible film.The kit comes with some application liquid. I was worried about using it because the PS Vita's battery is non-removable. I just powered down the device and did  not turn it back on for at least 48 hours. (warm summer weather also helps drying time for any liquid that may have entered)As I applied the protector there was areas with very small, micro, bubbles. The film has some kind of adhesive and I did not want to pull it up and have it not stick again or disturb the adhesive because it may be a one time only application for the film. There was even a large lump of micro bubbles in one corner of the screen along with a wide row of these same bubbles down the center of the screen. I used a paper napkin to soak up any of the liquid that exited around the edges and the speaker area.Once all the liquid was squeegeed out the film looked terrible. There was also two places with some dust specks under the film. But the enclosed instructions said bubbles would disappear so I let it go. I first let the Vita dry up face down to give any liquid that may have entered the speakers a chance to run out.After about 24 hours, the bubbles shrunk down to half of what there was. Around 36 hours they were gone and the large lump of bubbles was gone as well. In 48+ hours when I went to turn the system on again, there was no sign of the bubble stripe that went down the screen, or the large lump of micro bubbles that was on the edge of the screen. The film even shrunk down around the small dust specks.Dust specks under the more common firmer films will show up as huge bubbles because of the air pocket the dust specks make. This film shrinks around the dust speck and you will have to hold the device at an angle and look for the dust specks to find them. This film hides them great!When applying the carbon fiber, I noticed some would cover the serial numbers so I opted out of applying the carbon around the edge and only applied it onto he back over the black area. The kit also comes with carbon fiber pieces cut out for Vitas with or without 3G door.I never want another one of those old traditional screen protectors again.

It is a great design, and I love the kickstand... but this was the first of two purchased in the last two months because the holsters crack within a month.  I think it is time to find something a bit higher quality.Edit: Perhaps it is better than I originally rated it.  As I mentioned this was my first case (first smart phone)I think maybe my expectations are too high since I've now cracked a THIRD holster made of this type of plastic.  I have never dropped my phone (Knock on wood.)  It is the stress of the case being in the holster has cracked each of my holsters next to the side tab.It seems I can't find a case that meets all of my needs.  I want a case that will cover the front face when I choose and has a kickstand so I can set the phone on the desk either vertically or horizontally.  This case met those needs but has a few down sides.  First, there is no tab on the bottom of the holster which leaves me feeling worried that the phone could fall out if I used the belt clip, so I carry it in my pocket.  Carrying it in my pocket creates another issue, when I pull the phone from my pocket then from the holster I have something in both hands and must then put the holster back into my pocket.There is another style which has a bottom tab and also allows you to place the case into the holster with the screen facing outward.  The kickstand is not on the case like this phone, but is on the holster only.  This is the other case I cracked prior to leaving my original review here.

The case is fine, though \"you get what you pay for\" kind of applies here. The sides are still pretty slippery despite other reviews. I am satisfied with the experience - but definitely nothing higher than that. So, 3/5 stars. More details on the case below:The people who claim the sides give the phone a nice grip are exaggerating a bit; or, perhaps they've never had a case above $10? I understand the Galaxy Nexus bare is very slippery, but this case doesn't add much more \"grip\" at all concerning the sides. Yes, I admit it is slightly better - but that's as far as I'd go if I were putting my word on it. To say it adds a nice grip is nonsense. The case is easy as all get-out to put on. You simply put one end of the phone in first (whether top or bottom), and then push the rest in. It fits snugly, so that's good - HOWEVER (all caps for a reason, this is important) - if you'll notice in a couple of other reviews, it is mentioned that the case kind of covers up the headphone pinhole, and/or mic, or some other part of the phone that shouldn't be covered if this case were made for this phone. I can attest to the fact that my case definitely almost covers up the bottom headphone jack pinhole. It's so close to not allowing headphones to be plugged in, it's kind of upsetting to think I spent money on it - it feels like it's not made for my phone because of this. Again, \"you get what you pay for\" applies here. However, headphones do still fit - and it's not difficult to get in and out or anything - so the functionality is still there. It's just concerning. You've been warned. Moving on - the best part about this case (and all of them, no matter the color), is it looks great. Come on, admit it, the main reason you clicked this case on Amazon is because of the huge Android (\"Bugdroid\"/\"Andy\") on the back - you want that on your phone! And, you should - it looks great and is a nice addition to any Android-powered device! Protection-wise, I don't know. It definitely doesn't feel flimsy in the least; it feels nice and solid/sturdy. At the same time, I know it's not the toughest case out there...brands like Seidio and Otterbox come to mind as tough cases I've had experience with.Despite my neutral review, I am contemplating picking a new color up. This \"Smoker\" color looks great in the Amazon photos here, but in person, honestly it's hard to see and looks more black than anything. I am wondering how the \"clear\" color shows up in person. Why would I pick another one up? - come on, this case is obviously a case for looks more than protection - I want one that I find the most aesthetically pleasing!Edited To Add: By the way, the item description on Amazon has a lie in it. It claims that it has \"Precise cutouts provide easy access to all ports while buttons have been covered for protection from daily use\", however no buttons are covered on this case for the Galaxy Nexus, at least. It's completely untrue. There is a cut-out for the volume rocker (button), and another cut-out for the power button (button)...I realize it says the ports have cut-outs, but it claims the buttons don't, and that's a blatant lie. If you're looking to buy this case but are concerned about this part, I'll be more specific: the charging port has a cut-out, as well as the mic, headphone jack, and speaker on the back. Even the 3-pin connectors on the right side of the phone below the power button, for the optional dock, has a cut-out. All have cut-outs. Do NOT buy the case if you want your stuff covered. DO buy it if you want everything to have open cut-outs, and a nice-looking Android guy on the back of your phone. :-P", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Decent.", "unixReviewTime": 1335744000, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2012"}

The rubber tip is extremely sensitive -- I can swipe through an iPhone or iPad menu with the barest of touch.  The matte, all-black (except for the Frieq logo in silver) look adds elegance to an otherwise functional device.  I call it my stealth stylus.  If I were to drop it on a dark carpet or under a desk, I might need a flashlight to find it.The stylus is approximately 4 3/4 \" long and 1/2\" thick.  Some people, of course, will find the thickness difficult to grip while others will love it.  For me, the biggest drawback is the lack of a rubberized or textured grip since the body's one-piece construction makes it a little slick despite the matte finish.  The inability to change the tip doesn't bother much as it does other reviewers since it takes only a light touch to get the job done.  I don't see the tip wearing out quickly.I have small hands, so the chubby body is not ideal, although the sensitivity of the rubber tip is excellent. Since this is marketed as a wide grip, however, and since people who don't like this kind of thickness aren't likely to purchase it, it deserves close to 5 stars.

All the photos were turning washed out and whitish. I finally took the case off and tested some pictures and magically no more issue. I think its the placement of the plastic around camera and the flash. Even without the flash on the photos are still washed out and white.It does have one other more minor issue. There is a sizable gap around the earphone jack and the bottomwhere the USB port is. After a matter or a day or two stuff collects in it like dust, hair and pocket lint.

For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.

The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger's servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that's a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity. Camera a nice feature, easy to email pics anywhere. A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email.

This OXA 30000 mAh battery is the only battery I have that can do that, and it still has power left over when it's done.  It can be used to charge a PC (not a Mac -- more on that later) or any one of a number of devices that use either USB cables or one of the ten power jack adapters in the box.  It comes with a power pack with an extra long cord (yeah!), a drawstring pouch, and a USB cable with various adapters (but not Apple's newer lightning connector.)I was a little disappointed that my iPad didn't charge more quickly when connected to the battery, especially since the USB output has 5.1 V output, more than enough for the 2.1 V iPad charging cable.  Still, the power is there, and I can run a depleted iPad off the current supplied by the battery.  The output for the laptop port (non-USB) is 19V.  I imagine that you could run a depleted PC off that kind of output.  Unfortunately, I can't run a MacBook off it because of the specific cables required to charge Apple laptops.  There's no adapter that will work.The OXA Frosted Box feels built to last.  It measures 7.75&#34; x 5&#34; x .5&#34;.  It's roughly the dimensions of my Kindle Touch, but, of course, much heavier.  I like that the battery is made to lie flat on a surface, with the output and input ports next to each other in the back.  The only thing it's missing is a second USB port for people who want to charge multiple devices at the same time.If you want lots of stored power for a PC laptop or a tablet, this battery is an excellent choice.

Perfect... until I started using it.  The weight distribution of the S4 was in no way taken into account when making the kick stand.  The phone is very top-heavy when propped vertically, and the stand's axis of rotation is only 1/2 way up the phone. Therefore, if a strong breeze or a slight vibration hits the phone, it topples over onto it's back. Probably not good for the phone, no?  Now, only a few weeks after purchasing the product, the kickstand has BROKEN ALL TOGETHER! Very cheap construction. Only two small plastic pegs are holding the kickstand into the track. I guess it wasn't designed to use every day, since BOTH the top and bottom connections to the case have snapped off.What's more is that the overall design of the case leaves the corners of the phone vulnerable to damage!  Take a good hard look at the picture... the case's side protection ENDS at the top and bottom of the phone.  Therefore, if you drop it exactly on one of these unprotected areas, you won't have such a nice new phone anymore.Don't get me wrong, its a sturdy case.

The sound is very good, the volume is loud enough for all but the loudest situations, the pairing was fast/simple, the range is exceptional, the battery life is impressive and the charge time is unbelievable.  15 minutes on a charger for a full charge!If there is a down-side, the earpiece options are excellent, however the soft rubber ear inserts are a bit fragile.  I tore mine removing it from my pocket so be careful with those.  If anyone knows where to get replacements please comment on my review.  If I find them I'll post it later as an edit. It still works, but probably needs to be replaced before it tears any more.One other note on the ear inserts: if you use the either of the ear loops you need to use the donut-shaped ear insert that comes with it.  It is removable and you can move it to either loop.  If you don't use it, it will tend to fall off and the volume will be too low because it doesn't bring the sound into your ear canal without it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Unit, Worth Every Penny", "unixReviewTime": 1340582400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2012"}

Or perhaps you spend a lot of time in an area without 4G service. Just remember that even if you make a great phone choice, deficiencies in the other areas can diminish your overall user experience.Don't move to a smart phone without some research into these choices. Which provider? Which mobile operating system? Who can offer me the best service, or the best combination of value and service? The rest of this review assumes you've already figured out why a phone with the Android operating system might be a better choice for you than an iPhone, a Blackberry or a Windows-based smart phone solution...Bottom line for the HTC EVO 4G: feature loaded, user-friendly and a hard choice to go wrong with in a crowded smart phone market.The phone ships with an impressive array of capability and apps, and finding and installing new ones from the Android marketplace is easy even for non-techies.Two very strong performers in the pre-installed applications are Google-powered Voice Search and Navigate: both are eerily good at delivering search results and driving/walking directions. This phone's voice-to-text interface is also very good, and can be used for both composing text messages and delivering search results without typing. Surprisingly, a voice-based dialing app that is part of the operating system's collection of widgets seldom gets one right. The Evo's on-screen keyboard is adaptive to your compositions over time, and will suggest auto-completes for words you frequently type.The phone includes two cameras: an outward facing high resolution (8 megapixel) still/video camera, and a front facing 1.3 megapixel camera for video applications. It ships with an 8 GB microSD card. One surprising oversight of this phone is the placement of the microSD card inside the battery compartment. Although you can move files to an from it via the USB port, this phone would be improved if the card were accessible without removing the back cover.In addition to the USB port, the phone has a 3.5mm aux audio jack and an HDMI port.The rear of the phone includes a \"kickstand\", allowing you to stand the phone on a horizontal surface when viewing the display in landscape mode (great for using the speakerphone or watching videos).Customization of the scrolling display screens is intuitive. In our house, even less technically savvy users were re-arranging icons and applications in no time.Each of phone, video and still image quality are satisfactory.The overall finish of this phone is --literally-- quite slick. It can go sliding easily on leather car seat, and both the screen and frame will attract and display fingerprints. Whether or not you opted in to the damage/loss insurance that most providers offer, I'd strongly recommend both a screen protector and some case or holster to offer a modicum of protection to the phone.Mnay options exist for protection, but for our multiple Evo phones we've found the following to provide a good mix of protection and price:--\"Fishbone\" protective case (red linked here; other colors are available)--SGP STEINHEIL Anti FingerprintSprint Screen Protector (Anti Fingerprint)Let these protective devices soak up the wear and tear instead of your phone and display.Other reviews have discussed battery life, and it's worth addressing. This phone has five separate radio transmit/receive devices:-the standard cellular (3G/CDMA) transceiver-the 4G transceiver-Bluetooth (for short-range use of hands-free devices and data exchange)-GPS receiver-Wifi transceiverEach of these devices will exert its own demand on the battery. Selectively turning them off when not needed, along with setting a shorter time to turn off the display (2 minutes or 1 minute) will go a long way to mitigate the battery issue. Additionally, there are extended life aftermarket batteries (usually with an accompanying modified case cover to accommodate their their additional bulk) that will easily get you through your work day away from external power.A note about apps:Android is a Google operating system, and access to the Android marketplace for additional apps requires entry through a Google/Gmail account (either existing or one you create when setting up the phone). In return for the apps, be aware that you surrender significant personal information on your phone, your location (at minumum the nearest cell tower, and in some cases your GPS-derived location) and details of how you used the phone and applications. Providing this information is the cost of admission for functionality of the apps. I'm not offering a value judgement on this...just pointing it out for your information.Finally, a note about pricing:Comparison shop and pay attention when you're ready to make the move to a smart phone. For the hardware purchase, you can expect to find considerable differences in the prices (even when upgrade discount and rebates are included) from different vendors. Be sure to check out each each of your provider's \"store\" (brick and mortar, by phone and online), big box stores and even Amazon's new wireless store. It's worth investing a couple minutes in this research to save a considerable amount on the purchase price.Becoming a smart phone user begins with shopping smartly! )-", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Smart choice in a dense smart phone market; great features, functionality", "unixReviewTime": 1297900800, "reviewTime": "02 17, 2011"}

VENT MOUNT:  the vent mount works great for me (2005 Mazda Tribute) as long as its attached to a vent that doesn't move up/down, only side to side.  The case/holster + vent mount w/ phone are too heavy for vents that can move up/down (at least mine.)  The vent holder can be adjusted slightly to allow you to get the best viewing angle.  It stays on securely = I'm pleased w/ this part of the product.  I use it both w/ my slim phone case and w/out.2.

The case/holster that goes between the windshield mount and the vent mount is quite nice, substantial, easy to get phone in/out of, phone is securely in place, nicley goes between landscape and portrait mode, am easily able to use my car charger w/ this = I'm pleased w/ this part of the product.  Again, I use both w/ my slim phone case and w/out.3.

Due to the upward angle this mount puts my phone at, I get too much screen glare to have it on the drivers side of the windshield (because my dashboard is higher on the drivers side and angles down on the passenger side) = can't use this in my vehicle.

I thought the speaker's shape and design looked pretty sleek and futuristic from the photos, but I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing a speaker from a company I hadn't heard much about. I'm happy to say that, after receiving my GOgroove BlueSync OR3, I was able to lay all of those doubts and concerns to rest. This speaker is really cool, and was definitely worth the price. The OR3 is very powerful for its size, and the Bluetooth connectivity is excellent. I carry the OR3 (very compact and lightweight) and my phone around the house, blasting music, just about all day long. The thirty foot range for the Bluetooth signal seems pretty accurate as long as your path is relatively unobstructed. I've used the unit for at least twelve hours since it arrived and haven't had to charge the battery since the initial charge. Over the weekend, I brought the speaker to a buddy's house for a BBQ. Many of my friends really dug the speaker's design and were pretty impressed with the audio quality and volume coming from such a small unit. The built-in controls for skipping tracks are also pretty convenient. I haven't had any issues or noticed anything I would identify as a weakness so far, but to anyone who purchases this speaker: read the manual! There are only three buttons on the unit, and some of the functions require holding a button down. For example, by holding the power button for several seconds the speaker will enter \"pairing mode\" where you can pair your Bluetooth device with the speaker. By holding the +/- buttons you can adjust the speaker's volume. Clicking these buttons, however, is how you skip tracks on your phone or mp3 player. All in all, this speaker is well worth the dough.

After using it a few days around the house, then letting my daughter (age 12) try it out, we've determined that she likes the design of these much better than I do. I thought I would like the over-the-neck design of this Bluetooth set, but it just wasn't for me.After using Bluetooth sets like theDinoTwin T1 Premium Sport Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Headphones, which has the Bluetooth receiver built into the earbuds themselves, having a cylinder Bluetooth receiver hanging from my neck like this one, in addition to wearing the earbuds, makes me feel as though I am wearing more equipment than I needed to. The sets that have the Bluetooth in the earbuds don't require you to wear anything around your neck at all. So after trying out both kinds, I personally prefer the headsets with the Bluetooth in the ear pieces.However my daughter likes the over-the-neck design of this Jabra headset. She prefers having the volume controls for her music within easy reach. So with the receiver around her neck, they are always easy to access. She is able to work the controls of this headset easier than the headsets with the Bluetooth in the earbuds. So your own personal preferences will determine which of these designs you personally enjoy using more.The earbuds included are acceptable. Better than the cheap plastic ones you sometimes get along with MP3 players, but they're not fifty dollar earbuds. The price you're paying is for the receiver, more than for the earbuds. Had they included a bit nicer earbuds, the sound would be so much better and would make this a 5 star product. They have included 3 different size earbud tips so that you have a few options for getting the best fit. I appreciate when companies do this, since I usually need the smallest size, otherwise my ears start to hurt after wearing them for a while.It's a decent Bluetooth headeset, with enough range of reception that I can set my iPhone down somewhere in the room I'm in and am able to walk around without losing the signal. Good for workouts or any other time you are within close range of your device. Charging is simple and if you have a favorite pair of earbuds already at home that uses a 3.5mm jack, replace the earbuds that come with this set with those instead and you'll likely find you enjoy the listening to music from this Jabra headset even better.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works with both the iPhone and iPod Touch", "unixReviewTime": 1377216000, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2013"}

{"reviewerID": "AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU", "asin": "B006ZPCQBA", "reviewerName": "Kaio", "helpful": [154, 161], "reviewText": "I downloaded a countdown app for my Thrive tablet a few months back and have been literally tracking the days until I was freed from my cell phone contract and able to jump ship.  In that time, I've done plenty of research into no-contract phones, and honed in on either Virgin Mobile's Motorola Triumph or Boost Mobile's LG Marquee.  I even bought a $5 flip phone at Target and activated it with $10 of minutes just to test out Virgin's network.  Both Virgin and Boost are owned by Sprint, and the cell coverage was just as good in my tests with that $5 flip phone.  So I've been itching to get a no-contract smartphone and stop being needlessly gouged by contract service providers.  I was leaning heavily toward Triumph, but at the last minute, decided on the Marquee for a few specific reasons.First Things First:Now that my Sprint contract is finally up, I feel like I've just been released from prison or something, and vow to never get suckered into another cell phone contract again.  I've been under contract with AT&T;, Verizon and now Sprint.  Of the 3, Sprint has the best prices and their service is on par with the other 2 providers.  I'm happy with Sprint's coverage, but the phone they sold me turned out to be a colossal dud a few months in, and they didn't care to do a thing about it since I was shackled for 2 years.  So I've been counting the years, months and days until I could finally be freed from contract oblivion and get a phone that actually works!  The phone I'm gladly dumping, The Samsung Moment, got 90 minutes of battery life at best, and took 10 minutes just to boot up!!  My \"wireless\" phone was constantly tethered to a charger, was plagued with CPU hangs and lock-ups, and virtually every task was the epitome of tedium.  Someone could literally die if they needed to rely on that phone in an emergency.  I'm in a wheelchair, and I'd be better off trying to walk to the police than call 911 with that piece o' junk -- good riddance!Pre-Paid Stigma?I don't get why most people willingly commit themselves to a 2 year contract with any service provider.  I was duped into the false sense of security just like everyone else, but I've learned my lesson.  Sure, maybe you'll get a \"free\" phone up front, or get suckered into believing the mail-in rebates are a great deal, or that 4G coverage actually matters when NONE of the providers can offer that speed consistently as of this writing.  But in reality, there's virtually NO reason to be bound to a 2 year contract.  I see how it benefits service providers, but there's virtually no upside to the consumer whatsoever -- nada, nothing, zip, zilch, zero -- period.  It seems prepaid cell phones have a stigma associated with them, hence why they're being re-branded as \"no-contract;\" because only poor people or those with bad credit get \"prepaid\" cell phones.  Well, I'm struggling financially now that I've been forced into early retirement, but my credit rating is still over 950, so the stereotype doesn't fit.  True, at one time, prepaid cell phones were old technology that no one wanted, but that's no longer the case.  Both Boost and Virgin have several smartphone options; even Blackberry if you're set on clinging to that dying brand.  But no-contract carriers are getting better phones now; a few are even top-notch.  Virgin has the Triumph and now Boost has the LG Marquee, which only a few months ago was a contract phone offered through Sprint.  Both are really great smart-phones, light years ahead of my last contract phone.  And both Boost and Virgin are owned by Sprint, so the fear of having terrible coverage are unfounded.  All told, the excuses with going the prepaid route have quickly evaporated.Motorola Triumph vs LG MarqueeI really loved a lot Triumph's features: fast CPU, huge screen, HDMI connectivity, excellent video quality, readily available Root mods, and the Motorola brand.  I did exhaustive research into this phone and was really set on getting it.  But one thing that really concerned me is Amazon suspended their sales of the phone multiple times after receiving customer complaints that their stock was defective.  I know tech stupidity is often at play as much as defective hardware, but it did give me cause for concern.  Then I read that Virgin was due to announce their new phone for the year, and it's going to be the LG Marquee, so that made me take a serious look.  And when Amazon finally got the Marquee on Boost, I decided to just take the leap and go for it.  It's not always true, but generally, new is often better in tech world.  Things evolve and change very quickly with tech, so a phone that was only a few months old, compared to one well over a year old, sounded more appealing to me.  And if it's true that Virgin will be carrying the Marquee as well, then there will be plenty of tweaks and mods available soon enough.Boost vs VirginSince both companies are wholly owned by Sprint, they both have the same coverage.  The real difference comes in the plans:  Virgin has $35 for 300 min, $45 for 1200 min and $55 for unlimited.  All 3 plans include unlimited text and data.  I thought I could get away with their $35 plan, but would have to really keep an eye on my minutes to pull that off.  Boost, on the other hand, just has a $55 unlimited plan which goes down $5 a month until you reach $40 monthly.  That sounded much more appealing to me, since there are many coupons available online that offer $25 off to new customers, and over time, I'd be getting more for less with Boost.  In the end, I'd just rather not worry about my minute usage.If Buying Online, Never Buy From Anyone But AmazonOf all the problems I read with the Triumph, the most common seemed to be activation issues from people who got their phone from a 3rd party seller, rather than direct from Amazon.  Frankly, you just can't trust where 3rd party stock comes from, or that it's even brand new.  Whenever I've had problems here on Amazon, it's always been with 3rd party sellers.  So I've learned to stick with buying from Amazon directly, especially with tech stuff.  Their no questions asked return policy makes it foolish to buy from anyone else, and it's the only way to be sure that what you're buying is actually brand new -- not refurbished, lightly used, or grey market -- just my personal experience.Enter LG MarqueeA HUGE selling point with me for the Marquee over Triumph is the screen.  Both are roughly the same size, but Marquee has a super bright NOVA display which can be viewed in direct sunlight, and still holds up at extreme viewing angles.  Also, Marquee is running a newer version of Android than Triumph, and while I have no bones about rooting any phone, it's not necessarily something I want to do if I don't have to.  So the newer OS on Marquee was another notch in its favor.  Plus if Virgin is going to be carrying Marquee as well, then it just seems to make sense to go that route over Triumph.Super ThinThe great thing about the Marquee is that it's very thin and light.  My last phone had a slide-out Qwerty keyboard, and I was concerned that I would miss that.  But the Marquee is half the thickness and weight of my last phone, which is quite noticeable when it's in my pocket.  As far as missing the Qwerty keyboard, that really hasn't turned out to be an issue for me.  I got a tablet last summer and have become quite accustomed to typing with a touch screen keyboard.  I'm actually just as fast with it as a physical keyboard.  So I haven't missed the hard keys whatsoever.Fast and ResponsiveMy last smartphone had to be the dumbest \"smart\" phone ever manufactured.  By contrast, this Marquee is a dream.  It switches from my different desktop screens smoothly and crisply, with no hangs whatsoever.  Occasionally there will be a slight pause when switching between apps, or pinch zooming, but nothing compared to my old piece of junk.  The graphics accelerator isn't as snappy as my tablet, but then no phone would be, because tablets have much faster processors.  I don't intend on doing much gaming or video watching on my phone, but have every reason to think that it could handle those tasks just fine.  The YouTube videos I've loaded play smoothly with no redundant buffering; no better or worse than any device I've used.  My tablet has become my primary go-to device, and I don't see any cell phone replacing my tablet's functionality.  So for me, Marquee fits quite well into my tech lineup, and holds its own.Battery LifeEvery manufacturer exaggerates battery life with their devices.  If you're a heavy user, then you likely won't be satisfied with the battery life of any smartphone.  Having said that, the battery life on this Marquee is light years ahead of that old piece of junk I just got rid of.  The battery is lasting me all day with light use, but it does drop quickly under heavy use.  I think under constant use, I'd probably get roughly 4 hours.  When I'd use my old phone as a WiFi hotspot, it would die after about an hour, even plugged into the wall.  So clearly it was using more power than it could take in.  I haven't rooted the Marquee yet, so I have not used it as a hotspot.  Since I have a tablet, I do the majority of my surfing on that, and just use my cell phone for calls and convenience; so I wouldn't call myself a heavy user at all.  But I'll post updates to the battery life as I get more real world use with it.  But overall, I'm quite happy with it, and don't feel like I'll be stuck in a lurch with a dead phone, like my last one.EDIT: Just ordered this 3900mAh High  Extended Battery with Back Cover which supposedly will over double the Marquee's battery life. I'll post back my real world usage when I get it.No BloatwareUnlike most phones, the Marquee doesn't come bogged down with a bunch of useless apps that nobody wants, and can't uninstall.  The Marquee is running a pretty stock version of 2.3 Gingerbread, which seems to be standard for these no contract phones.  My guess is since they are a low cost service, that carriers are not wasting a lot of time developing custom operating systems, which is fine by me, since it offers a truer Android experience.RootingSince the Marquee is still quite new, there isn't a lot of root info out there just yet.  But I have found root mods for the LG Esteem, which will work for the Marquee.  Rooting can theoretically open you up to malware, since it grants access to the system files.  However the benefits likely outweigh the risks, as you'd be able to use the Marquee as a WiFi hotspot under your unlimited data plan with Boost.WiFi TetheringThere are several apps out there that claim to add WiFi tethering capability to cell phones without rooting your phone.  I intend to explore those options, and will post an update here, if any of those apps pan out.  Be aware that using your Marquee as a hotspot goes against Boost's service contract, however, I'm not too worried about it, since I only intend on doing it occasionally.  I think where you'd run into trouble, is if you start tethering your laptop to your phone, and then download a bunch of movies, and use a ridiculous amount of data that no cell phone would clearly use.  In my case, I would just like to tether my tablet when away from home, and no free public hotspots are available.  Since a tablet uses data essentially the same way as a cell phone, I don't think Boost would ever notice the occasional tether with my tablet.  Just be smart about it, and you should be fine.  Having said that, I have no plans to root my phone, if any of the no root required tethering apps pan out.Bluetooth ConnectivityThis was one of the areas that concerned me with the Triumph.  I read several people were having problems keeping their headsets connected.  I keep my phone connected to my car's hands free speaker phone, and the connection has been good for me so far.Sound QualityThe Marquee has pretty decent audio quality from the speaker.  No, it won't compete with a boom box, but it's much better than my last phone, and plays pretty loud.  I haven't used the Marquee to listen to music just yet.  I haven't been doing much of that lately with my cell phone, but that might be because I stopped doing anything extra with that old piece of junk phone I had.  If I get into it more with this Marquee, I'll post any updates if they're merited.Call QualityNone of us want a cell phone that can't get a signal or has terrible call quality.  I would guess this is the number one stigma against pre-paid phones.  However this Marquee is much better than my old Sprint phone, and I'm quite happy with the call quality and signal strength of this phone.Video QualityThe Marquee can play video up to 720p HD, and shoots HD video as well, however, the frame rate doesn't appear to be true HD at 24p or 29.97fps.  When shooting video, the quality is quite good, but I suspect they're trimming the frame rate as the video does stutter when panning from left to right.  It's not noticeable during filming, but is apparent in playback.  However, this is getting a little nitpicky, but it's worth mentioning.  Overall, the video quality is quite good on the rear camera, which is 5mp.  The front camera is only 2mp, and noticeably lacking in comparison.  The Marquee does take good pictures as well.  And the NOVA display is stunning to use while taking pictures or shooting video.  The screen also renders the live camera with no hiccups or artifacts whatsoever.  That would be in part due to the awesome NOVA display.  It's also worth mentioning that you can shoot video with the LED flash on, and that little LED is quite bright.  So if you want to download one of those silly flashlight apps, you'll probably have one of the brightest ones out there and blind someone while finding your seats in that darkened movie theater.NOVA DisplaySupposedly the NOVA display draws 50 percent less energy off the battery than a standard display.  This would be key, since these large screens are a huge reason why battery life is so terrible with all smartphones.  And yes, this display really is crisp and clear, even in direct sunlight.  I saw a side-by-side comparison with the iPhone 4, and the Marquee had a much more vivid display.  I'm not a fan of iPhone comparisons, but the screen quality is worth mentioning.  I haven't yet put a screen protector on it, but do have one of those military grade, helicopter blade protectors that I may use.  I'm usually a big believer in those, but for some reason, I'm still on the fence with whether or not I'll be adding it to this phone.Storage SpaceLG claims you're getting 4gb of storage right out of the box; 2gb onboard, and 2gb with the included micro SD card.  I have an 8gb from my old phone installed in the Marquee.  Keep in mind, that you never get the full advertised gb as you always lose some to formatting.  So that 2gb card that this Marquee comes with is more like 1.7gb.  Better to get a bigger card, and not worry about it.ActivationLike my $5 Virgin flip-phone, I really love the streamlined activation process.  I even kept my old phone number, and it was all quite easy to do.  Last time I bought a phone, I was in the store 3 hours just trying to complete the entire purchase.  By contrast, Boost has been a dream; Amazon shipped the phone straight to my door, and I was up and running shortly thereafter.  Being in a wheelchair, this is a big deal, since going to stores that are rarely accessible is a huge pain.  So the ease of purchase and activation, coupled with all the money I'll save monthly, makes this purchase a no brainer.ThrottlingUnlike their parent company, Sprint, I completely expect my data speeds to be throttled with Boost.  I'd rather it wasn't, but that's likely the trade-off for the cheaper monthly fees.  Virgin throttles for customers who use more than 2.5gb of data a month.  And Boost likely does the same.  Personally, I'd have a hard time using 2.5gb of data a month, so I think I'll be ok.Bandwidth - The Future CommodityI wouldn't be surprised to see bandwidth become a commodity as valuable as crude oil.  In fact, it's already happening, and it will only get worse as more people jump on the 'Cloud' bandwagon.  There's a little thing called Spectrum... and there ain't enough of it to go around.  Spectrum is essentially bandwidth; similar to a freeway, if all the lanes are clear, then it's full-throttle, but sometimes you hit gridlock and can't drive the posted speed limit.  All the cell carriers are struggling to sustain the bandwidth their customers are gobbling up.  It's part of the reason why no one can offer 4g (or even 3g) speeds consistently.  Personally, I'm not interested in funding cell carriers tech upgrades via overpriced monthly service plans that tout speeds they can't even deliver.  Wake me when your towers are ready and can handle the traffic, until then, I'll stick to paying less with Boost.Footnote to AmazonAmazon has done an excellent job in revolutionizing the tablet market with their Android hybrid Kindle Fire.  They should take things to the next level, and become actual service providers with no-contract cell phones and WiFi hotspots.  Their name recognition and track record for offering quality products at a reasonable price could do a lot in erasing the stigma associated with no-contract cell phones.  Communications and data really is the future of technology; Apple knows it, Google knows it, and Blackberry has fond memories of it.  Amazon knows it too, hence why they're edging in that direction.  And becoming a no-contract service provider would be a great way for them to continue being a trend setter and leader in the tech world.  Take it for what it's worth, Amazon.  ;o)Bottom LineSure, you could get a cutting edge smartphone under contract for the same money, or less, than this Marquee.  But is it really worth being shackled to a 2 year contract and paying at least twice as much monthly?  You don't really think those phones are free, do you?!  Carriers know they've got you on the hefty monthly premiums.  And those newfangled cutting edge phones will be quickly devalued by the next new kid on the block.  To me, it makes much more sense to get a solid piece of technology that I have the freedom to upgrade anytime I want, and not be bound to any carrier.  At the end of the day, if the service is exactly the same, then why pay more?  Remember, 4g speeds are not available everywhere, nor are they consistently offered, even in the markets where they are available.  3g isn't even available everywhere, so a lot of people are being suckered into technology that isn't yet fully supported.  Besides, with my tablet, my cell phone is actually only needed for calls.  Hmm... imagine that!  I'm quite happy to have finally come to my senses, and released myself from contract hell, so I can benefit from these great no-contract phones and services.  So, why 4 stars  instead of 5?  Because while this is a great phone with a great monthly price, it still isn't the most cutting edge phone on the market.  And even though it's far better than my old phone, the batter life could still be better.  But none of that should deter you from getting this great phone, and the awesome no-contract service.  So, jump on in folks, the water's fine!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Motorola Triumph vs LG Marquee & No-Contract Cell Phones vs Contract", "unixReviewTime": 1330128000, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2012"}

I'm even happier with the HF2's.One concern that I always have had with the ER6i's is that the cable always seemed like it could snap away from the earbuds.  Now, that has never happened to me in the year of constant use in New York City - but still, they seem fragile.  The same connection in the HF2's has been redesigned and now it looks very sturdy.  The wires are connected to the earbuds by a sturdy rubberized-plastic anchor piece, built right into the earbud housing.The cord is about six inches shorter than my ER6i's, but is still plenty long to have the phone/player tucked in my back pocket.  Wires seem sturdy and is one solid cable all the way down to the male plug, which looks cleaner (instead of two smaller cables stuck together like the ER6i's).The voice/microphone hangs at just the right level to my mouth and works easily.  There is a little 'bump' switch that sticks out and you use that to activate the mic and take/hang up on calls.  Works exactly as it should and you don't have to worry where it is . . you just put your thumb there and trust that it will 'click'.The sound is fantastic - nice and clean.  I know these might seem expensive, but if you love music and don't want to destroy your ears with overly cranked audio - then invest in a good pair of earbuds.  With these isolator type earbuds, I can totally hear everything in the music - even on the subway - and keep the overall sound level down.  I probably listen to music at less than half the volume on these earbuds than most people do with regular earbuds - and have a much better listening experience.My first pair of high-end earbuds were the Ultimate Ears super.fi 5 Pros.  Those were great, but I did have a problem with my first set and had to get a replacement pair.  Those also suffered from the same disconnection, cable to earbud, and I stopped using them.  They had a great sound -nice and full - but I always felt like the earbud was too big and heavy, and wrapping the stiff cable around the back of my ear was a bit much.My second pair of high-end earbuds were the ER6i's - great full sound, very bassy.  Nice and light, easy to put in and remove, and have proven to be very sturdy (I'm pretty rough on equipment).The HF2's are the next step in audio for me.  The sound is extremely clear and balanced.  In some ways the bass isn't as big as the ER6i's- but I think in the better way, meaning the overall sound is more accurately representative of the music.  It's like there's more presence to the sound, meaning I can listen to things even quieter but still enjoy hearing every instrument or nuance to a song.  The bass end has more clarity rather than pump.Overall, I love 'em.  Cheers.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Extremely Clean Sound", "unixReviewTime": 1216252800, "reviewTime": "07 17, 2008"}

It's great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it.

I purchased the iPhone4 within the first month of it's being available and immediately noticed that the reception was bad. People couldn't hear me talking to them and calls were dropped on a regular basis. But I kept \"4\" because it is marvel of modern engineering and beautiful to look at and a wonder to hold.Besides, texting is the new talking and I needed a mini-computer on my persons at all times.  So, I purchased a cheap temporary case which I promptly returned after Apple sent me the free bumper I ordered.The bumper is very minimalist so I can still appreciate the phone's good looks and the quality of it's calls quickly improved- not one dropped call when the \"4\" is encased.  I was happy.  Until the small scratch I discovered right on the Apple logo one day!  Then, it suddenly hit me- \"THIS PHONE IS MADE OF GLASS, back and front, AND I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PROTECT IT!\"  I knew that just one-drop at a bad angle at which the glass comes into contact with the sidewalk and it would be all over. Even if the phone continued working, I wasn't going to walk around with a phone bearing a cracked display. YUCK!Hence the search for the very best case for my iPhone began. First I went to Bestbuy to visually inspect and physically handle some cases.  I saw that only the Defender blocked the dock opening which is important for me since that opening allows dust and debris to enter too easily. Then I spent hours on amazon looking at and reading about 4 different suitable cases.Instinctively, I knew that the Defender was what I NEEDED but I thought that it would be absolutely sacrilege  to cover-up the 4's beauty. I turned to reading all the reviews on amazon, starting with the negative ones- like I always do. What I read disturbed me.  People were saying that the case makes the iPhone too bulky to hold, that it attracts dust like a magnet, even going so far as to state that that it couldn't fit in ones pocket!  Well, because of those negative people I held-off on getting the Defender for about 2 weeks even though I knew that only it would offer me the piece of mind I so desperately needed.The Defender was added to \"my cart\" on amazon and I mulled it over in my mind.  On the same day on which \"my cart\" informed me of a price drop, I said \"What the hell, I can always return it\" and ordered it.I am now whole and all is well with the world.Here are the...PROS:1- The \"4\" is now very well protected. Front, back, sides, top and bottom. Everything. A see-thru layer of plastic protects front from scratches. Flip-down rubber hatch protects the dock entrance on the bottom. Rubber hatch protects the headphones port on top when not in use. You just lift it when needed, which is great because now even thick plugs will fit, unlike with the bumper that I was using before. Protection for the volume button and the power button is built-in, molded into the case design. One last hatch on the side protects the silent/vibration switch.2- Speaker, microphone, camera, flash, and sensor are unaffected but well protected.3- The holster is very well made and holds the phone securely. You can hold the phone with the screen showing or flipped over. I don't use headphones often because I like to keep my ears open to other sounds as well, so I sometimes holster the iphone with the screen showing(so that I can use it without unholstering it) and the speaker pointed up towards my ears and listen to my podcasts and multitask.And the CONS:1- If you keep it in your pocket, then yes, the silicone will attract lint- ie: \"pocket debris\".2- This case will double the thickness of the \"4\"  (But it will be well protected and I noticed that it now feels better in my hand. The chances of my dropping it now are slim to none!)3- There is no instruction booklet explaining how to get it on to your phone, only a diagram on the inside of the packaging which lays it out for you in a too-simple kinda way.Warning: Do it right the first time. If you aren't \"mechanically inclined\" then get someone who is - to get this IRON MAN case around your \"4\".And there you have it, 2 hours of my time spent ranting about my experiences.So, if you feel you need this level of protection then just get it.  You will get used to the size very quickly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "i am iRONPHONE !!", "unixReviewTime": 1286582400, "reviewTime": "10 9, 2010"}

The Jabra has no issues with that. Since it hooks around your ear and fits snugly in your ear, sound is no problem coming or going. The volume adjustment is very easy to use without having to look at the earpiece and the tone is not tinny or robotic - the incoming voice sounds perfectly normal. The 6 hours of talk time and 8 days of standby time is a lot better than my previous Bluetooth and the charging is great. The USB charger angles conveniently to charge from your computer and only takes a little more than an hour to fully charge (on a new set). You can also charge in your car with an adapter such as the Universal Apple iPod USB Charger Kit - USB Retractable Hotsync Cable - USB Home Travel Charger - USB 12V Cigarette Lighter Charger.If you want to just walk around your home and talk, plug in then Jabra USB link into your PC and you can wander anywhere (within 30-33 feet). I found no interruption, even when in the bathroom with several walls and appliances in between. This is obviously much better than holding a phone with your hand. The earpiece comes already paired with the USB link. Pairing to your phone is just as easy as any Bluetooth. Tapping on/off is simple as well, however voice activation does not work on all phones. I have an iPhone 3G and it does not have the capability of voice activation. However, the 3GS and above do have the capability when you download the &#34;Fonix iSpeak&#34; application.This Bluetooth is comfortable, very easy to learn to use and is reasonably prices.

It slides conveniently on the sun visor for handy access. Answering and ending calls is a simple matter of tapping on the front of the case. The sound is of excellent quality and the volume is adjustable.Aside from being a well made and fine performing speakerphone the most important feature of this device is to provide support for safe cell usage while driving.

The cable by Pawtec provides the same transfer and data speed as the original for those who are primarily concerned about its true purpose. Although, it does exactly what it should in comparison, the most unfortunate thing about this cable is that the ends are on the slightly thicker side.So depending on whatever protective case you are using on your device, the Pawtec Charge and Sync Cable may be a little too fat to plug in all the way in to your device's charging port.

As it is right now, I'd say &#34;It's OK&#34;.It works flawlessly, if a little inconvenient. Most power banks I own start supplying power when it is plugged in. For this one to start charging, you need to first press the power button. It does turn off automatically after about 10 seconds or so. If you quickly disconnect one device and connect another one, it will continue charging.It has one Lightning connector and one micro USB cable. Unfortunately, you cannot connect your own cable to it, so if you have two iPhone or two devices that uses micro USB, you're out of luck. iPhone owners might be able to use a micro USB to Lightning adapter to charge two iPhones at the same time. And obviously, only devices with the Lightning connector (iPhone 5 and later) can use this.The shape makes it easy to hold, though it is fairly large for its capacity. I did not open it up, but it looks like about the correct size for 2 18650 batteries, 2600 mAH each. It's slightly curved to make holding it easy. A bit too big for pants pocket, unless you wear fairly baggy pants.It managed to recharge my phone (Galaxy Nexus, 1750 mAH battery) almost 2 times from empty, which is about what I'd expect for a power bank of this capacity. It takes a mind boggling 7+ hours to recharge from empty. There are 3 LEDs that indicate the state of charge - 1/3, 2/3 and full respectively. If it is empty, it will show one blinking LED. When charging, the top most LED will be blinking. I let it charge until the top LED stopped blinking. I was using a 2.1 amp charger as well, so it wasn't for lack of current. From calculations, that means it recharge at around 0.3C, which is nice for the battery's longevity - unless you're in a hurry. The power bank is rated for 500 cycles (again, about what is expected for 18650 batteries).In summary : It works well, slightly inconvenient, built in cables, and takes a long time to recharge.

Packaging/Shipping.My order arrived March 11, which was way before the estimated arrival of March 19 - April 10. That was a surprise as I know shipping from Hong Kong takes at least a month. Was very happy to get my order before expected!BUT!!!  As soon as I got my package, I knew it would be damaged. The seller shipped my cell phone cover in a small manilla envelope, non padded, with no bubble wrap or protection of any kind. The cell phone was in a plastic bag from the manufacturer. Knowing this order was being shipped to the U.S. - the seller should have protected it much better. It is afterall NOT an Otterbox, and it is a very fragile cover. I do not understand how certain sellers would risk a bad reputation with sub par packaging/shipping. My case was broken at a corner, the corner piece broken off, so it won't hold the cell phone.The case itself is cute. The Hello Kitty is 3D, has lots of crystals. My HK kitty has a black crystaled bow instead of a gold bow with a center black crystal - but that wouldn't have been a deal breaker for me - it is still cute. It is plastic, The inside of the case has a strip of black velvet. The outside has a strip of leather or leather like fabric with the #D Kitty. I haven't had the opportunity to see if my phone would fit due to the corner being broken off but I would hope it would hsve fit properly.I won't return it for a refund or to have it replaced because number 1 it will cost me more to ship it back to the seller then the $5 I paid for it, and because I don't want to wait 2 or more months to receive another one. It would take a month for them to get this broken one and another month for me to get a replacement.All in all, my case arrived broken due to poor packaging/shipping by seller.

Wrong.That's what I though after taking it out of the box.  Its a light unit, it does not feel like there is a battery/electronics in there at all.  But this thing works beautifully!  Some of the reviews mention that it takes hours for the unit to solar charge, and that it might melt if you leave it on your dashboard in the sun.  Not true.  I live in Georgia.  The summers here are HOT.  Getting in your car after leaving it in the July sun is like climbing into your oven at home.  On a recent day trip I left the charger on my car's dashboard in the July sun, and it had charged to full during the two hours I was gone from my car.  And it did not melt into my dashboard.On another day trip my Droid Razr was dying (poor battery life is the norm for that phone), and I simply pulled the charger from my pack, plugged in my Micro USB cable, and put the battery unit in the pocket of my shorts along with my phone.  It didn't feel clunky or anything, and it charged my phone.  What more can you ask for?This is a great charger for the money, especially when you compare it to other solar batteries like the GoalZero ones.  I'm sure they work just as well, but IMO they are way too expensive for what they do.Some other little tidbits I'll offer:-I've charged this unit by plugging the special (included) USB cable into a Kindle power Adapter and one of the mini Apple power adapters, and both charged it perfectly.-Its small, so it fits in a backpack, purse, or pocket really easily.-I have not tried this yet, but you can add additional solar panels to improve the battery's charge time when charging from the sun.  Out of the box the battery comes with a hook dealie you attach to the side, then attach to the extra solar panel.-The case itsself is made of a good, solid plastic which can take some abuse.  I would try to keep the solar panel away from any situations which could damage it, but it should be okay handling day-to-day usage (i.e. keeping it in a cluttered bag with all kind of pointy things).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great on-the-go power", "unixReviewTime": 1345766400, "reviewTime": "08 24, 2012"}

I wanted this one as it stated it was for multiple charges for multiple days .... and that is what I was looking for.What arrived is a pretty bare bones package.. Just the charger and one usb to micro usb cord.  you can  charge it with that kind the included cable or the( Extra purchase) charging pad.The unit is the size of a deck of cards but much heavier. I can be carried in a pocket or purse but the weight would be noticeable.  And as the unit does not include connectors to the usual electronics, i.e iphone, android phone, ipad  or android tablets.  You are expected to provide those connectors using your own charging cables.Then once you turn it on .. it is hard to tell how much charge the unit has.. one tap and one tiny light comes on . and a 2nd tap and 4 or so light s flash ?...So are your fully charged , partially charged or almost dead ?..  Your guess is as good as mine.. I read the enclosed manual for instructions but that didnt' help much.So I thought I would give it try.. not knowing if it was fully charged or not, I connected to my kindle tablet.. which has about a 49% charge.. left it connected OVERNIGHT  In the morning.. a whopping 80% charge,  huh ??...So thinking perhaps the unit wasn't fully charged to begin with.. I connected it to the power souce and left it over night.. again . I couldnt' tell if it was fully charged or not.. so I connected it to my Nexus 7 tablet.. well after approx 4 hr  89% charge.. that is pretty darn slow compaired w the previously owned chargers but will chg over night and see if that works.at this price point for a simple battery charger. I expect it to come COMPLETE  with a variety of adapters.. NONE were provided..The battery pack's I have previously purchased came with multiple connectors to make it easy to attach to what ever device you have.. This Duracell comes w one simple micro usb connector.. and you are out of LUCK if your device uses another kind of connector or you will have to use the cables from the device  which can be very inconvenient as those cords are LONG and  aren't nice to pack for a simple day trip.All in all, I am not very happy  with this device..  at 8800 mAh capacity; I can get a comparable unit that comes complete and  it is easy to tell how much charge is present and all the  connectors are included..  at 3/4 of this price of this unit.HOW long should we expect to get out of this unit.. ???  It says 4 CHARGES  but charging WHAT.. there is a whole lot of difference in chging a cell phone vs a tablet vs a laptop.. so what does it chg ???  All this abbreviated information should have been the clue about this unit.. but nope I had high hope for a Duracell product..  so this has disappointed meI shouldn't have to GUESS all these things, when the price is over three figures....Sorry I  wish I could give a glowing  recommendation and that it far exceeded my expectations but sadly it does not, in its current configuration. There are other chargers out in the market place that provides all needed  cables, cords and adapters when you purchase a charger. for a much lower price point  and provide more up front info on how to use the unit and  what length of charge time I could expect..........A little more work is needed to make this particular unit competitive", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ok as a charger  but missing adapters for most electronics...", "unixReviewTime": 1383091200, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2013"}

Using the included tips (Apple 30-pin, Micro-B, Mini-B, and PSP), you will be able to charge nearly 90% of the devices out there today.

The unit features a quick read display of five (5) blue LEDS indicating the power level in percentages of 20%.Overall, theBolse AON6 Dual USB Output 5200mAh External Battery Packis a great device for a great price.  It appears well made, is quite durable and performs great with the devices I use every day.  I would recommend this portable power bank for business and leisure travelers, the extreme gamer, the gadget obsessed and anyone who has had a device lose power at the most inconvenient time.  The AON6 is a great buy and is a great investment.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

I know this is an issue for all smart phones, but the battery life on this is horrible. I must admit that I use it mostly for browsing, games, apps, and music, all things that totally consume the battery. If you use it mostly for texting and talking, I'm sure it would be much better.So other than the battery life, this phone is perfectly amazing. I LOVE it. Love, love, love it. I have had it since 11/10 and even though there are newer version of this, Droid 3 and Droid 3 Global, I am little tempted to buy one of the new ones since this one is so great.Takes great pics and I have so much fun taking random videos on it, like my mom when she dropped a vase and busted it, and my nephew playing in the yard.I love the browser. It's not super fast but it is almost like having a mini laptop. I check Amazon on it daily, read horoscopes, Facebook...any website I check on my laptop and Xoom, I look at on my phone, too, on a daily basis.It has completely eliminated my need for a digital camera and mp3 player. So many tools in one little phone.My advice to you, my friend, is to get this phone or one of the newer Motorola Droids. Buy a car charger, which you can buy through Amazon for about $6, and buy a couple extra chargers, one for work and one for recreation because you will surely need them. Buy a Otterbox Droid 2 case. It works perfectly with this phone. I bought several cheaper ones that scratched and wore out until I finally bought the Otterbox which I have been using for several months with only minor surface scratches. Buy some cheap screen protectors.And, my last bit of golden advice is to download the Amazon app store. They offer a free paid app daily and I have probably downloaded about 50 since it launched. No strings. Free games, news, etc. Oh, and also the Amazon MP3 app because it is better than the on phone music player.I loved this phone so much that I bought a Motorola Xoom.

The others that were with me when I used it were very impressed at my gadget.  During the trip, I was using my phone as a camera, so the battery was draining quickly.  I hooked up the solar battery pack and gave it a boost.  However, I was still trying to use my phone as a camera, which made trying to hold the phone and charger a little tricky.  Using the suction cups or figuring out a way to fasten it to yourself would be a good idea before you set out.It worked and did it's job though.  You can charge it with the sun over the course of many hours in direct sunlight, or you can charge it quickly by simply hooking it to the wall or even a USB source of power.  This is a great because you can have a full battery before even setting out and if you use it sparingly the sun will help sustain the battery life even longer.Worth the money if you find yourself often running out of battery and not very often by an outlet.

{"reviewerID": "A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN", "asin": "B00FF1EBLS", "reviewerName": "Raven A. Wind", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I have a lot of headphones and headsets. I have Bluetooth models, a couple high-end wired ones, some studio headphones for when I'm making music, and other little cheap-o earbuds and things for convenience. That said, I rarely use most of them. Some are just uncomfortable, some are inconvenient, and some don't please me with their audio quality. For the record, I absolutely HATE beats by Dre (and Monster, masters of overpriced accessories and hyperbole) and I'm none-too-fond of 50-Cent's bass-heavy headphones, either. My favorite `phones have been my trusty Koss PortaPlay (purchased 20 years ago, and still outperforming most in the price range and lasting longer) and my BlueAnt headset. My least favorites (aside from the aforementioned fashion accessories by Dre and 50-Cent) are most earbuds packed in with anything, and my first pair of lower-priced, over-ear Sony Studio Headphones, which had excellent sound quality but had a tendency to crush my ears and head, making extended use impossible.When I got the TRITTON Kunai headset I was expecting something in the middle-of-the-line range, and for the most part that's what I got. However, the build quality and sound are much better than I expected from accessory company Mad Catz, who have made some of my least-favorite controllers and game accessories over the years. Clearly, they brought their A-game to this headset. I was impressed.&#9658; Build: The TRITTON Kunai feels nice and solid. The whole unit has a nice rubberized feel. It's like these headphones were made with shark skin. They're sturdy, and the magnetic, replaceable, colored side panels allow some customization without a lot of effort.The cable is hard-wired into the headphones-- something I consider a negative-- and the in-line controls are, in my opinion, WAY too close to the main unit (and your head) making it impossible for you to look at the controls when you use them. I would have preferred the controls to be lower by about 6\", because I'm not always certain I'm hitting the right button despite the raised symbols on them. My fingers just aren't that sensitive, and I'd like to look at the controls when I use them sometimes.The ear cups are very soft and feel great. Oddly, they're rectangular-shaped instead of circular or oval. They do a great job of sealing and providing maximum comfort while blocking out the outside world and keeping your music or phone conversation to yourself.The cord itself could be longer at 3.9 feet. It's not a major complaint, but with it being hardwired into the main unit, it means you have to consider an extension if you need more slack.&#9658; Sound Quality: These have a range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz. What that means is that don't get super-bassy, though they handle bass well, and they don't get up in the highs that I, as an adult, can no longer even hear. That's OK for me. For a teenager these might seem a little more limited in range because they can hear more high notes than I can.The mids are fine, not muddy or \"thick\", and everything is clear. As headphones go, these are a couple notches above average in terms of audio quality, but they're not any threat to Sennheiser, Klipsch or even some of BlueAnt's best stuff. I think they're better than the bass-heavy, muddy garbage by Dre or 50-Cent, but then I'm not a huge hip hop fan (at least, not hip hop after 1990) and like to hear details in my music, which the TRITTON Kunai handles admirably well. Again, not top-of-the-line by any means, but certainly not junk like many headphones on the market these days.As noted previously, these aren't super-bassy. If you're a bass fan, you may want to stick with the other guys. If you want clear bass that mixes with the rest of the music, then these might do the trick.For voice, they're good. They do add a richness to voice calls that isn't present in my Bluetooth headsets and earpieces, and they do a great job of filtering out noise.&#9658; Function: The TRITTON Kunai headset is pretty specific in the title about being for Apple iPod, iPhone, and iPad. This isn't a lie. I tried these on my Android phone and they worked fine as a headset, but the controls were completely useless. None of the in-line controls worked. I couldn't control volume, playback, pausing, or answering the phone with them. This could be because my phone didn't play nice, or it could be that they were serious about the whole \"for Apple\" thing.However, in the quick-start guide, they also list the PS Vita, Nintendo 3DS, the Wii U gamepad, and \"Tablets/Phones\" as being compatible. What \"compatible\" means is questionable. I guess your mileage may vary. The packaging says the in-line controls are only compatible with Apple devices, so I'm thinking the compatibility with those other devices may not include the in-line controls and is only referring to their function as a headset. You can get the microphone and headphones to work but you can't control the device with the headphones.On my iPad mini, the TRITTON Kunai performed well. Double-clicking the middle button skipped tracks. Single-clicking paused and played. the volume buttons worked as they should. I was pleased, and found myself wishing these controls worked on my Android phone.&#9658; Packaging/Info: The packaging is, frankly, a mess. I won't consider this in my review score, but it should be known that Mad Catz really made a messy package here. The outside sleeve has ALL information presented in five different languages, which makes it cluttered and hard to find what you're looking for.Inside, they provide a two-page quick-start guide and direct you to go online for a full manual. Considering the price of this headset, I'd think a physical manual wouldn't be too much to ask of them.They also provide some stickers with the TRITTON logo on them. I have no idea what I'd use these for, but perhaps they'll appeal to teenagers who like stuff on their locker or Trapper-Keeper. To me, they're silly fluff and I'd rather have seen them spend the printing efforts and material on a real manual.&#9658;&#9658; The Bottom Line:  The TRITTON Kunai Stereo Headset by Mad Catz is a great wired companion to your iOS device. Good sound, excellent comfort and build quality, and some nice customizing touches make this headset a good choice. I have to dock a point for the short cord and in-line controls too close to the main unit, making it a little more awkward to use them. This lost point is also considering the odd choice to include stickers instead of documentation. Still, this is a well-built headset that will satisfy most buyers who want it for an Apple device.If you're looking at this headset for Android, Windows Phone, or any other device, you may want to knock another star off my review, because the headset won't do much of what you're looking for, and it's not designed for those devices. It will support them to some degree, but it's not going to do the job if you want in-line controls.Recommendation:  If you're an Apple device owner, get it. If you're not an Apple device owner, shop around first.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Far better than I expected from Mad Catz", "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2014"}

As a road warrior who's always going, sometimes by foot, sometimes by plane, sometimes by public transit, and sometimes by car, it's always useful to have extra power with you on the go. When you're on the road and don't have access to a wall or car charger, or when you just need to be on the move, the iTorch is perfect. I've been a long-time user of the New Trent Power Pack (Model IMP500), but believe you can never have too much power, especially when others are always asking for a boost. I love both New Trent products, and my old device has saved my butt on more than one occasion. What I really like about the iTorch in particular is the added bonus of the laser pointer and flashlight. It may sound silly, but it's already come in handy several times. I try to minimize the clutter in my bag and therefore never have a flashlight on hand. There are times, however, when a little light can go a long way. As a professional, a laser pointer for presentations is great too, and not one that takes little expensive watch batteries. BUT, to focus on it's main purpose, the iTorch is compact, portable, and easy to handle. I utilized it last weekend and managed to go from Friday morning to Sunday night without ever needing to plug my iPhone 5 into a wall; I made it most of Friday on my initial charge, and added two days of typical use using the backup external portable battery. I could have gone longer. The iTorch is not the most powerful external battery, but it's also not the heaviest! This thing is light weight! While there are other products that might go further, this little guy can give you the boost you need (for your iPhone, iPod, iPad, Camera, Bluetooth, etc.).

I was hoping that this one was an exception, but after a few months of gentle use and great care, I have been entirely disappointed.I won't make a grocery list of glitches and crashes, it'd take far too long. Just know that if you go into this thinking \"But I just want it for X feature\", you'll probably be disappointed. My cell signal is weak compared to other phones with the same company. The battery life is painfully weak. Buttons to call your contacts just don't respond. Occasionally, text fields will ignore all input, making it impossible to type anything, anywhere, until you reboot - which takes a weirdly long time. The wallpaper doesn't even stay up. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Don't even get me started on apps - native, purchased, downloaded, they crash all the same.This phone's strongest selling point is the Google Play Store, which is expansive, reasonably-priced, and very secure. However, that comes with any Droid, and if you are looking into the Droid OS, don't let this discourage you - I hear wonderful things about other Droid phones. But this isn't the one for you. And mind, this isn't just one buggy phone.

It is a great companion for thos days when you know you will be using your device a lot and not be near an outlet for a prolonged period of time (outdoor trips, conventions, visits to family/friends and dont want to sit near an outlet or carry your chargers...just a usb cable etc).

If nothing else is connected you can just use the 2A port as it will only supply what is needed. But do no connect something that may draw high amps to lower amp ports. I am sure it has protection from such things but you can never know if everyone has designed things the right way and its better not to find out.I believe it supports up to 3 devices connected at the same time up to a maximum amp level.

I did notice that taking photos with the iPhone is not as easy as I would like, so I was excited to check this item out.It is nice that this grip is adjustable to work around any case or protective cover that you have on your phone.  This camera grip works with the free Belkin LiveAction app only.  It does not use the camera app included on the iPhone.  That would be fine, but I think the shutter speed is even slower than the iPhone camera app.  Plus, it is still difficult to not jerk the phone when pushing the button to take a picture.  So if you actually need a really good quality photo out of your camera, just use the remote on your iPhone earbuds that came with your phone.  I lost mine, but I know that it worked great.  I wish I didn't loose mine.Also this grip has a way to easily switch between taking video and taking photos.  One thing that I found useful is the tripod mount.  That is something that does not come with the iPhone.  OK not all the time does one carry around a tripod, but if you wanted to be in the picture without looking like you were holding your phone with your arm in the picture, there is a 5 second timer and a 10 second timer.The instructions that come with this grip are not so great, in fact, there aren't really instructions, just warranty information.  On the Belkin website, there isn't much information either.  It's just something you would have to play with and figure out on your own.

This appears to be a Chinese to English translation and it is very difficult to understand what the instructions are telling you to do.

So I would recommend you have someone with their primary language as English type up better instructions on the back of the package if these are to be sold to US customers.The next thing I noticed is the pens center of gravity (see attached screenshots). With the pen fully extended the center of gravity is too far back on the pen so it flips out of your hand; it needs to be a bit heavier toward the tip of the pen.  Also when its fully extended its still too small for the large size of my hand so its almost better to not extended it at all.  (See attached picture of another full length pen to show how I like it to rest on my hand like a normal pen or pencil does)Next I have a drop holster for my Droid X which I wear on my belt so with the pen in the headphone jack while it works its probably not something I would keep attached.  I would probably just keep the pen in my backpack and pull it out whenever I needed it.I really liked the micro fiber tip on this pen, it was so much better then the cheaper rubber tip pens.  It was able to glide across the screens of my devices much easier and felt more natural.  My only question would be would the micro fiber tip ever get snagged and tear after long term use?

But after the tragic end to my last phone (took a spill in St Louis and it was all downhill from there), I decided it was time to at least try to protect my new Nexus 5.It's definitely a slim case, and maintains the overall aesthetic/feel of the phone itself. The side buttons are fine-- as I'm not a case person I can't really tell you how they compare to other cases, but they seem perfectly reasonable to me.

I have generic Qi chargers in my life, and have an AirDock on it's way to me (about which I am mega excited).

My average battery temperature has gone up an average of at least a couple of degrees while I've had the case on, charging or not. Whether that's bad for the phone or not is tough to say, as I don't have another identical phone on which I can test the alternative.I like this one enough that, assuming the AirDock works with this case on, I will likely accept it into my life full time, as I do want to protect my phone and like the aesthetics of it just fine.

{"reviewerID": "A2DKQQIZ793AV5", "asin": "B00GK745L2", "reviewerName": "Twister", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Typical for other New Trent products I received in the past, Ultra arrived in a premium package with a flip cover and a lot of info to walk you through all the features even before opening the box. Available in two finishes, orange and gray, for my review I chose an orange finish since it will stand out better in any outdoor situation and will be easier to locate if you drop it or misplace it. Yes, I did say &#34;drop it&#34; which for it's IP67 rated enclosure shouldn't be a problem. Of course, such protection comes at expense of an additional weight and size bulk, but it's manageable. With a dimensions of about 5.5&#34; x 3&#34; x 1&#34; it's about 1.5 times thicker than a typical ext battery of such capacity. Also, at 366g it's a little heavier than other similar capacity batteries. But upon closer examination you will realize that additional protection layer fully justifies this extra bulk. The front and the back of the battery are made from a durable scratch resistant PC material, while the edges enclosed in a dense rubber material with a ribbed case design that gives you an excellent grip. You have full corner and side protection and both front and back have 8 standoffs to keep Ultra from sliding off any slippery surface.On a front of the battery, you have a power switch, fully sealed and rubberized, next to 4 blue led indicators for 25% capacity/charge incrementing indicators. The design of the switch prevents any accidental turn on where you have to press and hold it for 2 seconds before you start charging. This is a very important detail since you can have this battery in a backpack with other stuff, and don't have to worry about accidental turn on/discharge. The charging micro-usb input is on a side/corner with a secure port cover. As a matter of fact, it's secure enough that you will need to apply some force to open it. The same with 2 output full usb ports. It designed like that intentionally in order to meet full water and dirt protection. As a matter of fact, the included detailed manual mentions that a battery has been tested to endure being 3 feet underwater for up to an hour.Of course, this is still a battery, so let examine it's functionality. As I mentioned above, it has one charging Input and two Output ports, rated 1A and 2.1A. According to the spec, the input is rated at 5V/2A which suggests a super fast charging of the battery itself. My battery came 50% charged, and while I was timing it going up to a full 100% charge using included high quality usb cable, I noticed that charging speed was more inline with 1A-1.5A which is typical for external batteries and their 5V regulated converters. Basically it means that a full charge from empty will need about 12 hr on average, but you have to realize you are dealing with a huge 14,000 mAh capacity and this charging time is very reasonable. Regarding a total capacity, as you can imagine it's a max rated capacity of the internal 3.7V battery, and while converting it to 5V going to your usb cable, the efficiency of the conversion will lower the actual available capacity, so you should expect realistically about 11,000 mAh. This is typical for every external battery as well, to lose total capacity due to conversion efficiency. Regarding 2 output ports, although they are rated as 1A and 2.1A, I was able to charge my Note 2 out of each port with max 1.8A speed. You just have to keep in mind that you are sharing 3.1A between two ports, so for example charging Note 2 and Nexus 7 will be done simultaneously at full speed, but charging two Note 2 phones will lower the charging speed of both.Overall, I was VERY impressed with a built quality of this Ultra battery. Without a doubt, high capacity is a huge plus and it will be fantastic for outdoor use. I have reviewed a ton of external batteries in the past, and can tell you with certainty that I'm not sure if any of those would survive a serious outdoor drop, and can tell you for sure they won't survive drop in a water or a mud. If you are doing a lot of outdoor activities or working outside and need to keep a rugged external battery by your side, there is no other choice I can think of now beside this new Ultra. Extra rugged design/enclose will also come at extra premium you have to pay in comparison to other batteries with a same capacity, but in my opinion it's well worth it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Top choice rugged battery with super capacity!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1390348800, "reviewTime": "01 22, 2014"}

Those who have used the speck candyshell without the card case know what I mean: cases get scratched/snapped. Repeatedly removing my phone from the case also causes the plastic to snap (cleaning or accessing the headphone jack).One note of caution: the case's 3mm headphone port works perfectly for Apple's headphones, but larger 3mm plugs may not make it.

I recently ordered (and returned) an iPhone 4 case with a 1700mAh battery built into it. The case was 9 times the cost of this battery and only charged my phone 10% more. That said, it does have it's drawbacks. Due to the curvature of the newer devices (iPod touch 4g and iPad 2) the battery will not fit into the 30 pin slot far enough to make a connection. The battery will light up and \"think\" it's plugged in, but it's not. It would not charge my son's iPod touch 4G no matter what I did. Much the same issue with the iPad 2. Just simply could not make full contact for a charge to happen.That said, it works perfectly with my iPhone 4 and original iPad due to the flat base. I let my phone die completely and plugged in the battery and it was charged to 60% in about 2 hours. I'm a little annoyed about this because it says it will charge my phone to full in 2 hours, but I think they're playing with words here because it may very well fully charge an iPhone 3G to full simply because of lower capacity. However, as I mentioned above, I paid MUCH more for a battery case that didn't charge my phone much more than this one did, which brings me to another minor complaint. The shape of the battery is rather awkward. It's almost half the size of the phone and it's not exactly comfortable to hold while the battery is plugged in. You get what you pay for though. If you want a quick boost to your battery while your phone is sitting in your bag, this will do the trick nicely. If you want to continue using your phone while it's charging, you're going to have to pay more for a battery case.The LED indicators are a nice bonus as well. I like to see how much charge time is left by noting how many of the LEDs are lit. After charging the battery, the FULL light was on, but I noticed the next day when I actually plugged it into my phone it was down to 3 bars (from 4). I definitely don't like what this indicates. If the battery drains 25% in under 24 hours with no use, I'm not sure how much I'm actually going to benefit from it. Only time will tell on that one.The size is small enough that I can drop it in my purse and forget about it until I need it. I also own the 11000mAh New Trent iCruiser which definitely has more bulk, so I have this little guy as an emergency backup. Overall, if all you need is a quick boost to your battery when you're away from a power source, this really can't be beat for the price. Just know what to expect and what not to expect and you'll be pleased with the value received.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Does NOT work with iPod 4G or iPad 2", "unixReviewTime": 1319846400, "reviewTime": "10 29, 2011"}

The lapdock itself does not have a processor on-board, but instead &#34;borrows&#34; that of the high-end Atrix to unlock a new secondary user interface. It does, however, have a built-in battery which can last over 8 hours(!) and some LED's that notify the user of the amount of battery life left. The build quality of the lapdock is comparable with that of an Apple Macbook. It's sleek, it's super slim, and it oozes the word &#34;premium&#34; when held in the hand. That's to be expected through, considering the somewhat expensive price tag.The dock connects the phone via microUSB and a microHDMI port, which means the phone can also be charged when plugged in. The lapdock feature- what makes the Atric high-powered smartphone stand out from the crowd- will please moderate users. When the phone is docked (microUSB and microHDMI ports used), the lapdock accessory becomes a Linex-esk netbook with an 11&#34; screen, stereo speakers, USB ports, a giant touchpad, a full chicklet qwerty keyboard, and a desktop Firefox browser. Astonishingly, the desktop browser is really responsive, and watching streaming videos (Hulu, SolarMovie, NetFlix) were often faster/more optimized than Chrome on a regular Windows computer. However, watching YouTube videos did have some lag, as did flash-heavy websites like The New York Times. The touchpad lacks multitouch, but is responsive like the keyboard. The phone's headphone jack can also still be accessed when docked.2 USB ports on both sides of the computer allows for basic files to be read and transferred to the phone's memory. However, unlike other lapdocks, this model lacks an SD card reader to create the thinner design. When docked, users can also access the regular Android screen of their phone (like using the lapdock as a larger monitor for the phone). In this mode, any Android apps will run, although it's not as smooth as the optimized Linux/Lapdock secondary UI.The lapdock is a great mobile companion which offers incredible battery life (8 hours & charges the phone), and sleek looks (metal, thin design). It won't replace a computer if you need constant access to things like Powerpoint Documents or such Desktop software- but for advanced web browsing and video watching, it does the job in style. Overall, a great concept from Motorola that needs some refining, but can be appreciated and applauded.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It Does the Job in Style.", "unixReviewTime": 1405641600, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2014"}

The sound quality is just OK.  If the phone reception is at all garbled this unit will make it worse.  At times I have to ask the caller to hold while I turn the blue tooth off in order to understand them.  The volume control is adjusted by moving your finger up or down on the surface of the unit.  This is somewhat problematic because trying to adjust the fit of the unit can change the volume.  The batter life is severely lacking, only two hours of talk time.  The charging unit is cute, but it's hard to get the ear piece in and out and is really not very handy.  To get reasonable talk time, you have to carry the charger with you (you don't have to plug it in the wall) and plug the ear piece into it in between long calls.  Just one more thing to carry in your pocket and loose. The real kicker for me is that it provides a very loose fit on my ear and tends to move out of my ear when I tip my head.  For a long time I've used a Plantronics unit that cost about 1/3 as much as this one and it has better sound, a battery that lasts for days and more straight forward controls.

What I found surprising was contacting customer service shortly after Otterbox acquired LifeProof earlier this year and getting little response the first time and no response the second. The form for service requires the serial numbers off the front AND back pieces of the case. The front was still legible but the back was not. I provided the front serial number because I could read it and it is the part with the problem and added a comment I could not read the serial number on the back part - NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I received a perky form letter from customer service asking me to remove my phone from the case, take a picture of the illegible serial number and send it back to LifeProof. I asked what good it was going to do for them to have a picture of the serial number when I couldn't read it with a magnifying glass and received no reply. I let the seal peel back for a couple more weeks and submitted a new form with a link to the requested picture of the illegible serial number. Again, NO RESPONSE.Amortized over the service life this LifeProof case cost 30 cents a day! For a product in this price range the customer support attitude and effectiveness is poor and it seems worse under Otterbox corporate ownership. The case itself is expensive.

{"reviewerID": "A3QJ6RVXSR8PLY", "asin": "B00ITILPZ4", "reviewerName": "George", "helpful": [131, 138], "reviewText": "After having purchased over 20 different power banks, I received this unit free for review.  It compares well with others in it's capacity class.  The slim, brushed aluminum case looks very nice.  It weighs 9 ounces,  measures 2 & 7/8 by 5 & 1/2 inches and 9/16 inches thick.  It has a small test button to determine the charge.  During re-charge the lights stay on; during discharge they light only briefly to conserve power.  It is capable of being re-charged at up to 2A. When charging other devices, it has dual USB outputs of 1A and 2.1A with single and dual lightning symbols.  The charging cord supplied is heavy duty and carries the high currents better than most.  Trying some other cords limited the current severely due to thin gauge wires.  Unlike most power banks, which show 3-4 lights for a long time then die fast, this unit still has 47% of its available charge when it goes to a single light and about two-thirds available when it goes to 2 lights on.Upon receipt, it showed two lights on. It charged to 100% in about 2.5 hours starting at 1.4A with a current meter in the circuit, which can limit the current.The 4 charge indicators are not linear.  Instead of each one representing 25% charge,when re-charging:all 4 on indicates  90-100%, so leave it on the charger a while longer after it lights that fourth light,4th blinking is 60-90%,3rd blinking is 30-60%,2nd blinking is 10-30%,and one blinking is 0-10%.  My rough checks indicate the re-charge lights work as specified.When discharging:all 4 on is 90-100%,3 on is 70-90%,2 on is 40-70%,1 on is 10-40%,and none on, but still providing power, is less than 10%.  My initial tests indicate that the fourth and third lights go out quicker.  Then the final lights last much longer.I started my tests with both outputs supplying .86A while maintaining 4.90V for a combined power of 1.72A.  After 2 hours, my Kindle keyboard was fully charged, having started at about half charge.  During that time the power bank got noticeably warm.  As expected the 4th light went out quickly and the third not quite as fast.  I continued charging the second device for another 2.6 hours at .85A.  Total power delivered was 1.72A x 2 hr + .85A x 2.6 hrs = 5.65 amp hours.  It then had one light lit.  I assumed it was probably near empty, so re-charged it in about 7 hours.For the second test, I took it all the way from 100% to empty as follows:Charged my Clip Zip from 66% to 100% at .15A in 40 minutes while the MP3 player continued to play.  Not a heavy test, but rather shows that the stated 80ma cutoff current is low enough to fully charge small music players - something many power banks cannot do.  About .1Amp-hr (Ah) supplied so far.Charged my simple Alcatel cell phone from zero to 100% with a starting current of .61A.  It finished in 1.75 hrs, tapering off at the end for another .8Ah.  Total so far of .9Ah or 9% of capacity - bank showed 3 lights - on the edge of the predicted state.Then I charged my ASUS HD 7 tablet from 56% to 100% in 2.25 hr, starting at 1.2A from the high power outlet.  44% x 3.8 = 1.67 Ah, 2.57 Ah so far or 26% of capacity - 2 lights still lit.  Amp-hr supplied was calculated from the charge state of the tablet, which may be on the low side, since the tablet was in sleep mode and drawing a small current. Predicted state would have been still 3 lights.At this point I had charged all my devices except some of the other power banks.  I picked a depleted ECTech 12K bank as the final test load, charging at a steady rate of .95A again through the current meter.  After 1 hour, the Poweradd bank was down to 1 light.  Total power supplied was 2.57 + .95 = 3.52 Ah or 35% supplied thus far.  Predicted state would have been 2 lights.  Not looking good at this point.  But I continued.  After another 1.85 hr the last light went off for another .95 x 1.87 = 1.78 + 3.52 = 5.3 Ah so far.  I figured it was near the end.  But it kept supplying .95A for another 1.4 hr, maintaining a steady 4.90V, with the current actually rising to just over 1.0 A in the final minutes.  So another 1.4 x .95 = 1.33 + 5.30 = 6.63 Ah delivered.  Total delivery of 6630 mAh x 4.90 V or 32.5Watt-hr.  Figuring the average Li-polymer cell voltage was 3.7V, the bank holds 3.7 x 10 = 37 Watt-hr for a decent converter loss of 12%.  After the last light went off, it continued to supply about 20% of the total delivered power, not 10%.  When it went to a single light on, it still had 47% of the total delivered power left, not 40%.Li-polymer cells sometimes take a few charge cycles to reach maximum capacity, so I will report again after a few more cycles.In summary, don't give up hope when those lights start going out, those last lights indicate more power left than you think.  It should keep delivering full current and voltage right up to shut down - much better than most power banks.  It is packaged in a slim, elegant case with good versatility.  Use the better than average provided USB cord, if possible, when transferring high currents.  Light duty cords will not deliver full power.  While you can use both outputs at once, do so with caution - that heat build up indicates extra power loss.  If you trip the (unstated) maximum current draw or hit the high temperature limit it will go into safety shut down.  That requires disconnecting it, cooling down, and putting it back under re-charge for a while to reset the limit circuits.Update 4/14/2014:Ran one more test today.  Discharged the bank from 100% to off at .83A to .89A, current meter in circuit always.  Obtained a total of 6950 mAh or 34.2 Wh at 4.92V output.  A little higher than the previous test showing only 8% loss in the converter.  During this test the lights changed by:4 lit - 97-100%3 lit - 68-97%2 lit - 47-68%1 lit - 4-47%none lit 0-4%This time the bank was near empty when the last light went off.  It still went to one light at about 47% remaining.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Slim Styling, Versatile & Convenient", "unixReviewTime": 1397174400, "reviewTime": "04 11, 2014"}

{"reviewerID": "A3UKPBTB65LLH6", "asin": "B003DQ1DCM", "reviewerName": "John Anderson", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Other reviews have described the unit well, let me share my experiences.I use this device with a Samsung Captivate and an Apple iMac running OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard.It paired with both instantly.On the Captivate, it works as advertised- streams music in surprisingly high fidelity, takes calls (pauses the music), and seems to have built-in background noise suppression (for the mic).  Audio quality listening to music, and on calls is very good.I did an A/B to determine the Bluetooth's effect on sound quality by playing a song on the Captivate through the MW600 for a few seconds, then paused it, swapped the included earbud's jack from the MW600 directly into the Captivate's jack and re-started play.  There was very little sound difference (plugging in directly sounded very slightly better, but not enough to matter).One drawback so far is that the song titles are supposed to display on the MW600's screen, but do not with the Captivate.  This might be an issue with the built-in audio player software in the phone, I'll try some other music software.  As far as I know the Captivate supports all the latest cool-guy Bluetooth standards.One nice plus is that the included charger uses a micro-USB connector, the same as the Captivate (and other phones, I'm sure), so I now have an extra wall charger that will work with both phone and MW600, plus I can use the Captivate's USB to Micro USB charging cable to charge both (off my computer's USB) when I travel and in the car.I paired it with the built-in Bluetooth on my iMac, set it as the audio in/out device in System Preferences> Sound, and played music with iTunes.  The sound quality was very very good, the transport buttons on the MW600 (play/ pause/ FF/ RW) controlled iTunes instantly (no lag), and the song titles DID show up on the MW600, streamed from iTunes, also instantly. Again, the response time from pausing, playing, or skipping forward or back was instantaneous, no lag.  I'm very impressed with the usage of iTunes streamed from the iMac to the MW600, it works perfectly in every way.With Skype, I set the MW600 as the audio in/out in Skype> Preferences, and was a bit buggy at first.  Skype locked up twice when I tried to place a call.  I finally figured out- OSX can see the MW600 as either \"Bluetooth Headset\" (mono) or \"Bluetooth Headphones\" (stereo).  If you set it (in System Preferences> Sound) as \"Bluetooth Headset\" (mono), it works perfectly with Skype.  Skype must not play well with stereo audio over Bluetooth.I placed a Skype test call, recorded my voice and it sounded fine.  Not landline fidelity fine, but o.k. for VoIP.The built in FM radio works well, my only niggle is that you can't program station presets, you either scan through available stations (press and hold to scan to the next strong station) or skip ahead 100KHz at a time (99.1, 99.2, 99.3, etc).  If you're say, at 89 and you want to tune a station at 106, you can't just hold the forward button down and scroll all the way there, you have to go one station at a time, or .1 at a time.  That's a drag.The MW600 automatically displays the station name, (\"Jack FM\", \"KCRW\", etc) when you tune it in, then scrolls the artist and song title as it plays (if the station supports it).One final thing, I compared the MW600 ear buds against the ones that came with the Captivate- the Captivate ear buds sound better- more bass, generally higher fidelity, so that supports other comments here that the included ear buds are not the best.  I have a good set of headphones tucked away somewhere, I'm confident that it'll sound great, used for air or train travel, quietly listening in bed at night while reading, etc.Others here have complained about the volume slider.  It is not really an issue for me.  Certainly, it's not as easy to use as a knob, but once you figure it out and use the MW600 a few times, you can get the hang of it.You put your fingertip on the raised slider area, press and slide toward the top of the MW600 (to turn it up).  There's a \"+\" sign bump at the top, just hold your fingertip there and the volume steadily raises, lift your finger when it's at the volume you want- the display shows a graphic of the volume level.  Do the opposite to lower the volume.  No big deal.So, to summarize, it works perfectly and flawlessly for Bluetooth functions on the iMac- Skype/ VOIP and iTunes streaming.It works nearly perfectly on the Captivate phone, the only minus is that the song titles do not appear in the window.The radio sounds great, has cool display features, but tuning stations is a bit cumbersome.It has a pretty incredible amount of features and quality, stuffed into a very small, very lightweight package.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid Bluetooth Headset, very compatible", "unixReviewTime": 1297123200, "reviewTime": "02 8, 2011"}

It is just the right length at 2 feet to put on the seat, console, cup holder, or phone holder, but short enough to prevent the user from being able to talk on the phone while driving - and it should be. It fits in the iPhone just snug enough to not fall out, but can easily be removed if needed to make or receive a call. The other end fits in the power outlet/lighter socket with the right amount of strength. I haven't plugged another USB device in the extra charging socket, but that's only because I really don't have anything else to charge. The TYLT ribbon cable charges the iPhone pretty quickly too - more like a quick charger than a trickle charger. Some other reviewers indicate the cable should have an LED to show the phone is charging, and that would be nice, but looking on the phone's display isn't that difficult. The flat ribbon design avoids tangling, especially during storage, I just kind of bunch it up and put it away.

I tested it using an iPhone 4, Samsung Galaxy s3, and a Nikon Coolpix s9200. Unfortunately when i was trying to charge my camera, it did not have enough power to charge it. I knew this was true because when i had plugged it into the wall at home, it charged up fine. It gladly charged up my other two phones.Tests:I was able to charge the iPhone 4 from 10% to 100% in about 4 hours. When it was done it had the last two LED's lit.Then, I charged my s3 from 27% to 100% which took about two and a half hours.

The speakers are large and you can pump up the volume with little in the way of distortion.  It would be perfect for an apartment, although it's certainly not high powered enough to propel a noisy party.The device is fairly intuitive.  It's easy to figure out on your own without the manual how to access the radio, bluetooth and auxiliary sound input.There are limitations to the A73.  It's supposed to be designed to lug around (and the handle and internal battery of course allow you to do that), but the base is kind of skinny, making the unit prone to falling over.  The main speakers are exposed (there is no grill), which means that they might be easily pierced and ruined.  I'd never take this thing out on the beach or to a picnic.  It's not robust enough.  It's designed to be carried from room to room indoors.  I would bring the A73 out to the backyard or to the driveway when I'm working on my bike or car, but I'd be careful where I placed it.A unit like this should have a USB connection for a flash drive in addition to the bluetooth and auxiliary inputs.  I don't understand why TDK didn't spend a few extra bucks to put something like that in.  Also, an AM radio band would have been an inexpensive, but valuable addition.Overall, it's the sound this unit provides that carries the day.

It ranks among the best on my speed test, charging faster than the competitors, and includes the best package for the deal overall. The features that stand out are the following:*  Travel kit includes protective travel case and USB wall charger which is not included in most competing products. Built in LED flashlight provides added convenience when needed.*  High Capacity 10000mAh with Dual USB output, 2.1A output charges most tablets efficiently while 1A output is used for smaller devices like smartphones and GPS.*  High compatibility - Charges most devices that can be charged via USB, these includes most tablets, most smartphones, GoPro, GPS, and some digital cameras.*  High quality grade-A internal cells with real 10000mAh capacity. Smart internal circuitry prevents short circuit, over-charging and over-heating.Package includes: 1 X Protective Travel Case, 1 X Ox-10 10000mAh High Capacity External Battery, 1 x USB Wall Charger, 1 X USB to Micro USB cable, 1 X Micro USB to Apple 30 pin connector, 1 X Micro USB to Mini USB adapterI have used this travel kit many times when I haven't had access to a plug and have found it a lifesaver.

None of the competitors include a travel case, a wall charger, a flashlight, a cord, or the plug adapters needed to charge most devices. I without hesitation recommend the Omi Labs Ox10 charger.

This was very very intriguing to the fact that it has a slide-out stand, which is probably it's biggest selling point.  Putting the case on was easy for the most part and requires a little forced at the end to cover iPhone controls.  Keep in mind that the case will cover iPhone's power and volume controls with case's own grey buttons, which I admit could cause trouble for certain individuals as it makes it slightly tougher to press now.  It makes a headphone connector slightly more recessed(about 1CM,) which isn't much, but could limit certain \"L-Shaped\" headphones from fitting.  The stand is very nifty and easy to use, and may seem that it only supports vertical view, but that's not true as you can turn the phone horizontally and watch YouTube videos on a flat surface with ease.BEWARE!  This case is almost impossible to take off!  Because it has a \"glove\" design and not a snap-on from both sides design, it is a pain in the neck(hands and even teeth if you are going that route) to take off.

Proulx \"Up to my Neck in Tech\"", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "The AR.Drone is a great idea, at least the Drone part of the name, not so much the AR (augmented reality). However, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired.This is a fun toy to fly when it behaves, but it doesn't behave too often. I've had numerous very erratic behaviors from my drone. When flying full speed in a direction, the drone often flips itself over. Despite having the altitude limited setting toggled on (should keep it under 10 ft high) I've had the drone ignore the altitude and fly up into a tree, breaking a plastic part upon falling. The drone will often erratically lose altitude and bounce off the ground with the propellors still running. Or, the drone will randomly fly up into the sky, without you telling it to do so. What is so frustrating about all of these erratic behaviors, is that they eventually end up in broken parts and you have to shell out more money buying new props, gear shafts, gears, or having to send the AR Drone in for a repair. I've bought theParrot AR.Drone Mounting Toolswhich I think should be included with this product andParrot AR.Drone Replacement Gear with Shaft Setwhich is helpful since the aluminum shafts are so easily bent and the gears take a beating on some falls. I do have to give Parrot credit for creating a product so repairable and having every part available. I am impressed with how will the drone holds up to some substantial falls, but due to the erratic behavior, there are just too many bullets for it to dodge. Eventually something breaks. I've had the styrofoam indoor hull break only once, but instead of ordering Parrots repair tape, I was able to repair it with normal double sided tape.Customer service has failed to impress me. After first noticing the erratic behavior, I sent an email with my issues. Parrot never responded to my email. I had to call them and talk to someone to get a return authorization. I paid for shipping to get the drone repaired, which was about $10-15, but they paid for shipping back to me. After getting it back, it still behaved erratically. So I sent it back to them after a crash had broken a part, again paying for shipping. I received it back with the part repaired, but it appears they never tried to address the erratic behavior this time. So I called Parrot again to have them address the issues, and they were very nice over the phone, acknowledged that the erratic behavior hadn't been looked at the last time, and said they would send me a return authorization and upon asking, they said they would cover the shipping this time. However, that was around 2 months ago, and I still have not received the return authorization. I've been too busy to contact them again, but I will soon.The camera quality is very poor on both the front facing and ground facing camera. This would be understandable, if Parrot didn't photoshop in very good looking pictures onto the iPhone controllers in all their advertisements. The framerate is poor, and so the augmented reality aspect of the drone seems like it would be worthless, although I have never tried. The battery life has been surprisingly long for me, somewhere around the quoted 15 minutes, which seems like a while when you are flying.Beyond those complaints, it is a very fun toy when it works. I've enjoyed flying it when it behaves, and it is great to show to your friends or tease your dog with. Unfortunately, judging from other people's stories about their drones, I'm not convinced that my drone has anything wrong with it, but am leaning towards the conclusion that most other drones are operating like mine. It seems like Parrot bit off a bit more than they could chew and that the first generation of the AR.Drone was more of an expensive beta than a polished product.I hope this review helped. The second generation drone looks to be pretty promising.

This last piece appears to give support to the back, but it also provides a stylish two tone. However, I wish it snapped into place better. It appears to be a little loose.The case completely covers all parts of the iPhone. Clear plastic is found over the screen, cameras, flash, and home button. The plastic is very durable and has a hint of a checkered pattern. When used over the screen, it produces a rainbow of colors noticeable when the screen is off. The screen cover is a little harder to keep clean than the iPhone screen and appears to attract more dust. The screen cover does not reduce touch performance.I was very surprised to find that the plastic over the home button does not interfere with the iPhone 5S fingerprint identification. However, it does make the home button significantly harder to push; over time, the plastic may stretch or break with repetitive pressing.Fabric is placed over the phone speaker. Holes are used for the bottom speaker and microphone. The headphone jack, charging port, and volume on/off switch are covered with access ports. Ports are easily accessible, but does cause problems when non-Apple cords are used. The volume, on/off buttons, and cameras work very well through the case.The case is advertised as being slim, and it is, but as with all complete body covers it does add bulk.

Jones \"Andy\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This vehicle dock is meant to work with the Atrix 4g phone, also from Motorola.  As a dedicated accessory to a specific product, it pairs very well with the Atrix phone.The car dock comes with a small insert that allows you to use your phone with it regardless of whether or not you have a case.  Some bulky cases might prevent you from docking successfully, but small form factor ones should work without a problem.  If you have no case or cover, the insert lets your phone slip snugly into the dock.  The insert sits in the dock itself, it doesn't have to be attached to your phone.  You wouldn't even know it was there after your 1st use.The suction cup is very well designed and attached firmly to my windshield.  I've had problems in the past with docks not sticking to my window, especially in very hot or very cold conditions, but this dock holds tight and doesn't so much as wobble.  Also included is a small 'cup' for attaching this to your dashboard.  I prefer the window mount, but you can attach to your dashboard if you like.The cord included plugs into a car power adapter (also included) and into the AUX port in your vehicle.  The power adapter has 2 USB ports on it, meaning you can charge another device while this one is plugged in, a great feature.  If you do not have an aux or input in your vehicle (or stereo) you might want to review your options for getting sound from the atrix to your car, but the phone will still charge, and you can always just turn the speaker way up.  I found I had no problem hearing navigation commands or calls over the phone speaker on high volume.When the phone is plugged in it automatically launches the dedicated cardock app.  This gives you several large icons, easy to hit with one hand.  There are several default ones, and multiple pages of customizable slots where you can add any program you want.  For example, I added Pandora radio app to my front page, as well as the 'camcorder' program.The default 'my location' icon is nice in that it acts as a compass, telling you your current direction.  If you click on 'my location,' though, the interface it launches is not ideal.  I found I had better luck using the google maps 'navigation' app included with the atrix.  When that program launches it offers voice search by default, whereas the 'my location' required you to hit a tiny button in order to do voice navigation.My only complaint with this product is that there was a production run of non-functional car docks.  That is, some docks do nothing when you plug your phone into them, they're not working.  A quick internet search shows that a certain number docks shipped with some kind of defect.  I ended up with one of those units.I was able to get a replacement dock through Motorola, but the process was not as smooth as I would have liked.  At first they wanted me to factory reset my phone, losing all my data.  Next, they wanted me to pay for return shipping (and, indeed, required a credit card number before they would honor my warranty).  In the end they replaced my unit, though it took a while and many many phonecalls.I give this product 4 stars overall.  This is a great great cardock, but it's a bit expensive and Motorola customer service was more of a hassle than they should have been.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Expensive, some bad units, but a good product", "unixReviewTime": 1317340800, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2011"}

Upon opening the Amazon shipping box, you see a really cool circular box containing the speaker. The packing inside is great; you know the item will not get damaged in shipping.Set up was a breeze. I connected to my laptop easily by pairing the devices. Connection to an iPad and iPod required downloading an app from the App store and then a few second later...they were connected.Then my disappointment began.I am no audiophile, but I was immediately disappointed at how unbalanced this speaker sounds.  It is definitely lacking in the bass range.  The treble / high end sounds are noticeably dominant.  If this were the only issue, I would rate this product 4 stars.The second star deduction comes from interference. I have tested the speaker in 2 areas of the house (1 downstairs and 1 up) and both times have experienced connection issues. This prompted me to explore how bluetooth works. At first I thought perhaps it was like infrared and was more line of sight.  Why? Because when I put my body inbetween the laptop and the speaker, the speaker cut in and out or it would have static sounds. I had the same experience with the iPod touch and the speaker. From what I read, this shouldn't happen. Bluetooth functions in the same frequency range as many other devices (around 2.4 GHz)and is not line of sight dependent. Not sure what the issue is.  There was no microwave running when these issues happened. We do have a lot of devices, so maybe that is part of the problem. If so, I would imagine most other people have their fair share of wireless devices and may have the same issue.Right now there are 4 other reviews of this speaker up and I seem to be the only one with this concern though.

This is what makes it useless. the arm attaches to the phone holder using one of those ball in socket joints..like garmin gps mounts. It just kind of flops around in its socket like the ball is too small for the socket. there is no way to tighten this up at all. So there is no way to position your phone or gps .

I have a problem with watermarks on the Defender on my 4S, and wanted to avoid that with this case.

If you only care about protecting your phone but still have a little pizzazz, then try the Otterbox.  Best bang for the buck that you'll get to protect your $$$ iPhone.Oh yeah - one more thing.

Overall I prefer the iPhone over the others and would recommend it, with a few minor reservations.The iPhone 5s is superior in these areas:1. The design is a work of art, finely sculpted and proportioned; a pleasure to hold and use2. The screen is fantastic; big enough to be really useful but small enough for the phone to be easily pocketable. The Blackberry screen was maybe too small for most applications except for email, and the Android too big and heavy for portable use. I particularly like the long narrow screen on the 5s3. A lot of thought has gone into the way a user can navigate around the screen through the different functions. I have owned an iPod Touch for a couple of years and have become a fan of Apple's clear and simple graphics: on the 5s, it's even better. The software never crashes, which it did with both my Android phones frequently4. For a user with larger than average hands/fingers, the on-screen keypad of the 5s is really well designed - especially true if you use the phone in landscape format which has the effect of widening the keypad. In comparison, the Android was frustrating and not very user-friendly and the Blackberry Storm completely hopeless - though the permanent keypad on the Curve was great5. The ring tone & speaker volume is louder and clearer on the iPhone than any of its rivals6. Phone reception is the best. I don't know how Apple manage this, but I have made and received calls in locations where other phones don't seem to work  - like travelling on the London underground and in deep underground car parks7. The camera is so good it's up to the standard of a dedicated Canon or Nikon compact, for the first time on a cellphone8. The memory (64GB) is vast, with a storage capacity so huge you're never likely to need more no matter what you download and store on it9. Siri, iMessage and Facetime are genuinely useful apps, not just gimmicks. They actually work well. The fingerprint scanner works too, though how much of a real security feature this is remains doubtfulGripes: very few -1. The battery life isn't great, but no worse than the Android Galaxy 4 and you can substantially improve it on the 5s by turning off power-hungry applications2. The unique nano-SIM means you can't swap the SIM over to another phone in an emergency, or for example if the phone is damaged and needs repair3. The price of the 5s is a bit steep, but here you really do get what you pay forOverall I have become a reluctant Apple convert. It's easy to see why they have become market leader with such an excellent product. Of course in another 2 or 3 years the tech will have moved on again, there may be a new market-leading manufacturer and the 5s will be an antique. But until then, the 5s for me is the King of cellphones.Finally, a lot of one-star reviews posted on amazon are from buyers griping about having been shipped locked phones by online sellers. This must be very frustrating but these are not really product reviews, they are complaints about the seller. The solution is easy: buy from an Apple store and they'll set up the new iPhone for you and transfer all the data from your old phone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "iPhone 5s: state of the art and hard to fault", "unixReviewTime": 1389744000, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2014"}

The 8800 was the one I was using until I was given the Bold and, up until then, I thought of it as the best Blackberry ever. Then, the Bold came and it is probably safe to state that the Bold is now the last and the best classic Blackberry ever because the Storm, lacking a physical keyboard, probably deserves its own class.When the Bold and the 8800 are placed next to each other, what's striking is the similarities between the 2. The exact same size, similar keyboard, buttons placement, including the now familiar trackball. Even the ports are more or less the same, the same weight. Mine came with its own holster but I could have used the 8800's with the Bold.Then, it's the display. The Bold is what it says it is: bright, clear, vivid. You see it and you now know that it's an evolutionary step up on the ladder. In addition, you get the camera that shoots both pictures and video and the ability to add more memory means that you scan store more video and more music if you want to use your Blackberry as an iPod lite. The operation seems to be a bit faster, the battery life is more or less the same, the quality of the speaker phone is better but, overall, it's your familiar Blackberry, having learned a few new tricks and with a bright face.I am happy with the Bold because I am happy with Blackberries in general. I like the unlimited email and Internet browsing plan, the ability to use Wi-Fi when available and the security it provides. My Blackberry is tied into my company's email environment and it is now very much an extension of my office while I'm away. The Bold, with its high resolution screen and the same solid, functional build is a good tool, now with more 'fun' stuff (camera, video playing) added to it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Best and Possibly the Last Classic Blackberry (with a real keyboard)", "unixReviewTime": 1227139200, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2008"}

Gallegos \"47 is the real answer\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I purchased this headset based on the top ranking Bluetooth headsets on Amazon. Plus I had already tried the newer model M165 and wasn't very pleased with it.First off, I like this headset so much that it's my second M50 purchase. I was an idiot and lost my first one on a business trip because I put it in a front shirt pocket instead of the travel pouch, which I also purchased from Amazon. At one point while taking out a business card or something else, the headset came out and I didn't notice.Everything has its good and bad. This headset is no exception. However the good is far better than the bad for me. I point out both so you will decide for yourself on whether it's enough for you to still purchase this headset. I won't comment on the visual elements of the headset. I.E. Looks, lights, ETC because I'm blind and such things don't bother me. I have also only paired this with an iPhone 4S, and an iPad Mini. However pairing it with other devices shouldn't be an issue.Pros:+ Easy to pair+ Small and light-weight+ Easy quick power on/off switch+ Good audio which supports A2DP+ Long battery life and quick charge time+ Uses standard Micro-USB charger - Not something proprietary+ Can wear all day with little or no ear fatigue in your earnow onto my issues. I have tried to keep them objective, but I of course realize that when making a product review, it's mostly based on one's own personal needs. I only mention this because the issues I describe below may not be issues for you, and so don't let my comments turn you away from this wonderful headset.Cons:+ Quality of calls. I can hear people just fine, and the volume is great. I usually don't have to set the maximum volume either. I'm usually using the mid-range volume and that's enough. However the people I've talked to have said that my voice is either too tinny, a bit distorted, or too digital. If the volume is set to maximum, callers report they can hear themselves echo. I suspect that when the volume is at max, there is a bit of feedback from the callers own voice which is picked up by the mic and that is what causes the caller to hear the echoing.+ The answer/hangup button. This button presents 2 problems for me. First, it's small enough, and located exactly in the center of where your ear is, resulting in an uncomfortable feeling when you press the button in to answer a call. Second, since this headset has A2DP support, meaning you can listen to music, podcasts, or GPS instructions while not on a call, I would have hoped that this button would, in addition to answer a call, also act as a pause/resume for the currently playing audio. I've had other BT headsets where the answer button doubles as a play/pause button as well and so find it rather inconvenient if I'm wearing the headset and listening to a podcast and want to pause it, I have to do it from the phone itself. To me, this defeats the hands-free experience. This may not be an issue for some, but if I didn't like everything else about this headset it would have been a dealbreaker for me.+ Built-in voice. There is a voice announcement when the headset is powered on or off, or when the battery is low. I find it a bit annoying that no matter what I have the headset volume set to, the voice is always at maximum. At least it sounds like it to me. Maybe Plantronics figures that if you are listening to something at the lower volumes you might miss the \"volume low\" announcement. I don't know.All in all, this is a good headset. If it fits well in your ear, if the lack of play/pause audio via the answer button isn't an issue for you, and if callers can hear you just fine, then you have made a good choice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Not the latest, but still the best", "unixReviewTime": 1369008000, "reviewTime": "05 20, 2013"}

I don't know if it was because I was used to the S3, but it just felt awkward and squarish to me. The HTC One M8 not only looks nicer but felt more comfortable to hold when I saw it in store. The HTC also sports front-facing speakers and has very clear sound quality, while the S5 seems muffled because its speakers are in the back (why they are in the back, I do not know).After powering the phone on and doing the initial setup, I opened up the camera. I took a couple test shots using the normal back camera, and then I tried out the front camera. To my surprise, the picture was distorted! It stretched the top and bottom parts of the frame and creates an odd, enlongated appearance. A quick google search revealed that other people are experiencing the same issue, and there seems to be no fix. For a premium, flagship smartphone, this is unacceptable. Perhaps for those who don't use the front camera this is probably not a big deal. But I couldn't stand looking at my stretched out face.Moving on to the lockscreen: Unlike the Galaxy S3, you cannot add lockscreen widgets such as Dashclock. I don't know why it was removed in this phone. The only thing you can change is the wallpaper and the unlock method. The finger print scanner leaves much to be desired. \"Swipe faster.\" \"Swipe slower.\" \"Swipe the entire pad.\" are the messages that I received when trying to use it to unlock my phone. I eventually had to use my backup password.Overall, I was disappointed with the Galaxy S5. I didn't like how some features were taken out and replaced by gimmicky features such as the fingerprint scanner and the heart rate monitor. I'm in the process of exchanging it with either the HTC One M8 or the LG G3 (soon to arrive in the US).", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not for me, but may be a good fit for others", "unixReviewTime": 1402876800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2014"}

I know how to install them, but someone who has never done it may not figure it out so easily.The kit also includes a small microfiber cloth for cleaning as well as a small plastic squeegee to help remove air pockets when applying the guard to your phone.On previous phones, I have always used a specific brand of screen guard that you can find at better retail stores.  They are somewhat spendy but I have always been able to apply them with no problem.The problem with these screen guards is the protectors that cover the front and back that you have to remove to apply it.  Out of three of these, the tabs to pull off the protector plastic ripped and I was unable to remove the backing without wrecking the guard. It didn't matter how softly I pulled them, in what way, it was like the backing was glued to the screen guard.  Ruined all three screen guards just trying to get the backing off.You get what you pay for, and after ruining all three screen guards, I went to Best Buy, paid $20 and bought the brand I always use.

The case is a hard, glossy black plastic that looks like it can withstand being jostled around in a bag and even take a small drop or two without suffering major damage.  The two electrical outlet prongs fold in and out when you need to charge the pack, and there is plenty of good resistance on the prong hinge.  Once they are open, they&#8217;ll stay open, and once they are closed up, they&#8217;ll stay tucked away.  On the bottom and side is a continuous piece of durable rubber with a micro-USB plug at the end.  The rubber arm can be conveniently tucked away in the unit, or removed to give you around 2 inches of slack to charge your device.  There is a female, full-sized USB port on the bottom of the pack, and a single button on the face.  Even the button has a good amount of durable resistance.  Hitting the button reveals a circle with 4 individual green LED lights around the circumference, each LED light represents about 25% of charge loaded on the pack.  All-in-all, I love the sleek look and durable design of this thing.Depending on what you&#8217;re looking for, though, the performance of the Tylt ENERGI2-T Energi might not be enough for your needs.  The pack will fully charge in a little over an hour.  From there I&#8217;ve used it to charge my HTC 8X (the phone has an 1800 mAh battery) using the built-in rubber micro-USB arm.  During tests, I left my phone on (4G cellular signal and actively connected Wi-Fi) but did not receive any calls or texts.  I had one push Exchange account active and two other email accounts that updated hourly running in the background.  The Tylt increased my HTC 8X&#8217;s battery by 25% in the first 30 minutes.  It took 60-75 minutes to completely drain the Tylt and it consistently restored 50-60% of my phone battery&#8217;s power during five tests.  I also fully charged the Tylt and used it to power a completely dead Kindle Paperwhite (1st gen model).  Again, it took about 60-75 minutes for the Tylt to drain and it gave the Paperwhite a 50% full battery.  Depending on your phone&#8217;s battery, your mileage may vary.  If you&#8217;re using a Galaxy Note, or something with a huge battery, I would only expect to gain maybe 30% of charge after an hour.  For midsized phones, I think around 50% is realistic.  I&#8217;m guessing cheap flip phones are the only things that might go from dead to 90% power.I&#8217;m giving this unit a 4-star grade because I absolutely love the design and durability, but wish that there was just a little more charge capacity inside for this price.  If all you need is an extra 30-60% cell phone battery boost at 5 or 6pm to get you to the end of the day, this Tylt won&#8217;t disappoint and will deliver the juice in black, glossy style.  However, if you need something that will bring your electronic device up to full power away from an electrical outlet, you&#8217;ll need to find a charge pack with a much bigger battery.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A stylish quick charge", "unixReviewTime": 1385942400, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2013"}

I liked this case the best of all 3! It is a lot better than the Stowaway, though a tough choice over the Smartflex. The case itself fits the iphone 5 great! All the buttons match up and the camera is not hindered at all. The only thing I really didn't prefer was the glossy finish (on both Incipio cases). The matt finish on the Smartflex looked better, but the feel of the Stashback is just fine. The case does provide as much protection as I need in a case without feeling too bulky (I even found a leather holster that fit this case!). In fact the extra bulk makes your phone fit in your hand better. The Stashback does just what it claims, it securely conceals up to 4 cards plus a folded up bill with easy access to your cards. The design does not feel flimsy and there is no play in the cover (which was the big problem with the Stowaway)! The cards slide in and out quite easily as well. The reason I ended up picking this one over the Smartflex was because I don't like that your cards are viewable on the back of Smartflex, a little unprofessional if you have your phone sitting out. The balance of practicality and good looks in the Stashback is pretty hard to improve on (and the glossy finish is easy to overlook as a minor thing). So if you want to be free of your wallet, I recommend the Incipio Stashback.

I'd also recommend getting a 'liberation kit' from iFixIt, so you can change the screws to standard phillips-head screws. Here's how to replace the battery:1. Remove the two screws on either side of the dock connector (bottom of iPhone).2. Push/slide back cover up towards top of phone (it will go up about 5mm).3. Pull back cover off the phone (this exposes the battery).4. Using a spudger tool, pry up the battery from the side of the iPhone, and carefully pry off the connector, being careful not to lose the little post that goes around one of the screws! (This is the most difficult part).Replacing the battery is annoying, but if the battery lasts twice as long as an old, worn-out battery, it's well worth it.Unfortunately, in my case, the replacement battery charged only if the phone was turned off completely, and wouldn't report back to the iPhone the correct charge level as I was using it throughout the day (it would stay at, say, 80% until I turned the phone off and on after a few hours--then it would say 50% until another on/off cycle). If I tried charging the phone while it was on, it would reboot itself every 3 to 5 minutes for no reason whatsoever. Very strange, and very annoying. I even reseated the power connector and that didn't fix it.In the end, I put the original battery back in, and even though it only lasts 3/4 of a day before needing a top off, it charges fine and doesn't exhibit any weird behavior.I contacted the seller, and they quickly allowed me to return the battery, so no sweat off my back.

The first thing that came to mind when I opened the box was the strong resemblance the case had to my wife's olderOtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 5/5s. The case comes in two pieces with a silicone wrapper for the phone itself that snaps into a hard plastic shell, which covers the back and sides.Overall the case met all of my requirements. However, I did take off 1/2 star from the case for a few reasons:1. Unlike the Otterbox Commuter Series Case, the bottom of the case does not flip open, so you may have problems using an older 30-pin to lightning adapter or some docking stations without removing the phone from the case.2. There was no screen protector included. TheAmazonBasics Protective TPU Caseis the low end of the price spectrum for Amazon iPhone 5 cases and it includes a screen protector, so I would have expected a screen protector with this slightly more expensive case as well.3. The hard plastic shell is somewhat slick, so your fingers may be prone to slipping off the back and sides.The only other comment I have is that the materials on the Otterbox Commuter Series Case feel more solid than the Amazon Basics case. I'm not concerned about damaging my phone, but there is a quality difference in the materials with the two cases. I didn't take off any stars for this though, since this case is about 1/3rd of the cost of the Otterbox case.********* I received this product for free as part of the Amazon.com Vine program.

They pair easily and range is good; pretty much on par with any of your standard bluetooth stuff. Bottom line is, especially at this price point, if you're an audiophile and sound quality is your number one concern, bluetooth is just not going to satisfy you.

If you're just looking for a minor amount of protection and a little extra grip, this is a great case.The Otterbox Defender is at the opposite end of the spectrum.

The resolution is second to none and the battery life is the best i've ever had on a smart phone. Additionally the touch interface is very responsive, more so than the previous Note 2. Moreover, it is also quicker than the Note 2 when bringing up apps and running apps. But, there are a few things that the Note 3 lacks in that the Note 2 had. One is that although the camera for the Note 3 is 13 megapixels and the Note 2, 8 mega pixels, the Note 2 seems to take better quality pictures. Further, the Note 2 had better low light visibility in the pictures as well. And, the camera view point seems to be more zoomed in at the furthest level from zoom on the Note 3 making me have to take a few steps extra backward to take a picture that I wouldn't have to do with the Note 2. Secondly, the video quality in low light lacks adjustment that the Note 2 had. In the Note 2, one could take a video without the flash and still decipher whats in the video pretty well. But, in the Note 3 even in a slightly dim room you cannot see what is going on in the video which makes talking videos from the phone quite frustrating. I don't know why Samsung took a step back on the camera on the Note 3 by taking away lowlight settings and replacing it with a auto adjust feature on the camera that is supposed to adjust to the different light conditions on its own. Which, it does not do very well might I add. But with that being said, the camera is not horrible, its rather on the better side of smart phone cameras. Another thing is the speaker phone isn't as loud as the Note 2's. That was something that I really enjoyed on the Note 2. Overall though, the phone is probably the best phone I've ever had and I've had the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5 along with the Note 2. The visual aspect of the display is awesome and the default storage is 32 gigs with additional 64 gigs addable storage potential. And, I appreciate the fact that one can take the back off and replace a battery or get extra batteries to charge on the side and replace when needed. In the end I'll rate the phone a 9/10 the only complaint being the camera functioning. Oh, and I have Sprint for my carrier for almost 10 years and I live in the LA area and have lived in many parts of NorCal and SoCal and in New York City and have never had a problem with reception.  I also drove across the country with a few friends who have AT&T and Verizon and I consistently had more service coverage than they did, as we had to constantly use my phone for GPS service in rural areas because their phones would get no reception at all.

Schmitt", "helpful": [9, 19], "reviewText": "I received my Q10 on 6/21 and after getting through all the activation issues, I'm still having some very basic, elementary lagging issues with my texting/BB Hub. We all know that texting is important and that it should be something that is very quick, especially nowadays, should be immediate. The issue I have is NOT NOT NOT with my network connection as it does this throughout the state and is solely within the OS. When I send a text, it takes about 30 seconds to actually show up in the conversation. I'm not referring to the time it takes to actually send, which would be fine, but physically show up in the conversation. On top of that, I can't send a text and then continue to my next text in that conversation until after the last text shows up. And all on top of that, I can't quickly move back and forth between conversations as it will keep going back to the last message I sent until the last message appears. I have spoken with AT&T; Tech Support and they couldn't do anything, now I'm going to have to do a full system restore and see if that kicks out any bugs in the OS. If that doesn't work, I'm taking it back to AT&T; and trying another Q10. If that still has the problems, I'm going to get a Samsung Galaxy S4.Please be aware that this is not just a personal issue, but blogs such as Blackberry and Crackberry, people all over are having this same issue and no OS update or resolution have been able to fix this problem. I will update if necessary, but if I don't, I've finally gone with a full touchscreen as I love the physical QWERTY keyboard. Its a disappointing problem as Blackberry was so confident with its marketing of the new 10s and multitasking through the new Hub software. Fingers are crossed for now that my issue somehow becomes resolved. Please heed this warning however because it may happen to you.***Update 6/25: I took the Q10 into AT&T; and they were as dumbfounded as I was. While there, I changed my mind about swapping for a new device and went with the Samsung Galaxy S4. I was hesitant to not only get a new device as I was worried it would occur in the future, but also with getting a full touchscreen keyboard as I have been Blackberry loyal for 10 years. I loved being able to feel the keys as I typed and not having to look down at the screen, much like typing on a computer keyboard, so it was an end of an era for me. Fortunately, the S4 was so much better in so many ways (ie, the keyboard is easy to get comfortable with and prediction is spot on but doesn't screw up your messages, and the S4 is so much more user-friendly and customizable than the bare bones Q10 - it seems like you can't customize anything with the Q10 like you used to be able to with the older BBs, and there are so many more useful apps available with the S4 - Gmail and Google Maps for two examples). So, with that said, in my review, I would definitely recommend doing away with a Blackberry and going with a more modern phone and be happier in the end after making the switch. This whole process was a huge let down and disappointment for me as I have been a big supporter of BB over the years, but this time they just fell flat on their face and let a lot of us loyal customers down.

Meaning, charge it up, run it down, charge it up, etc... instead of keeping it plugged into the charger all the time - which is what i would normally do while at work.

Also note, I am using the term \"adapter\" and \"charger\" interchangeably in my review.I recently reviewed Belkin's new single-port charge:http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FSR5PG57WP5Y/ref=cm_cr_rdp_permBelkin Home Travel Wall ChargerI also wanted to provide information on the Ventev since it's just as powerful, has 2 ports, and is less expensive than the Belkin charger. I bought my Ventev at top dollar price at the At&T; store, then later found it on Amazon for a GREAT PRICE ($16) and free shipping.I have been confused over the years about the various adapters that come with my iphone and ipad and the charging rates. I wondered why it took so long to charge my ipad using my iphone adapter. Also, why is the adapter that comes with the ipad so big for the ipad vs the iphone? I did some in depth research to educate myself that I would also like to share with you.First thing you need to know is that it's not the cable (on fourth generation i-devices using the smaller, fire-wire connections) that makes the difference in charging speed, it is the adapter (the thing you plug into the wall with the USB port). The Ventev charger will make a difference on the iphone and ipad mini as I describe the reason why below.You need to understand wattage. Wattage (also know as power or amount of juice flowing to your device) equal voltage times amperage, so:volts x amps = watts.Not all adapters are the same or even labeled visibly, so really take a look at the technical specification before making purchases. All the apple products use 5-volt along with the Ventev charger which is also 5-volt.  You can also quickly look at the amperage if watts isn't listed, to tell the difference in speed.So, if you know at least 2 of the 3 (volts, amps, or watts), you can figure out the third. The iphone, ipod, and ipad mini all have the same adapter/charger and it list the volts and amps, but not the watts, but you can easily figure it out with the equation:5 volts x 1 amps = 5 watts (iphone, ipod, ipadmini)The ipad is printed loud and clear with the wattage: 12W. Apple does this since there's been so much confusion in the past since a similar looking charger was available in 5-watt and 10-watt versions.5 volts x 2.4 amps = 12 wattsThe Ventev  adapter I am reviewing is  2.1 amps or 10 watts so it is slightly slower than the ipad adapter and twice the speed of the adapter included with the  iphone, ipod, and ipadmini.5 volts x 2.1 amps = 10 wattsSo, what does this mean for the various apple i-devices as far as charge speed and how is this Ventev charger going to perform? Well, it all depend on how much the individual devices draw or pull from the power/wattage.For example, if the unit draws 10 watts and you use a 10 watt adapter/charger it will charge at it's maximum speed. If the adapter is slower, like 5 watts, it's going to take twice as long to charge. If the adapter is faster, like 12 watts, it's only going to charge at the unit's maximum speed which is 10 watt*.Here's the line-up of individual apple devices and their wattage.iphone and ipod:  7.1 watt (comes with a 5 watt adapter)ipadmini:  16.3 watt (comes with a 5 watt adapter)ipad 2:  25 watt (comes with a 10 watt adapter)ipad 3:  42 watt, the most power-hungry (comes with a 12-watt adapter)So, compare that with the wattage of your adapter/charger with devices wattage:The iphone and ipad will charge slightly faster with the Ventev 10-watt adapter (5 watts vs. 7.1 watts, since it will draw a maximum of 7.1 watts)The ipadmini will charge significantly faster with the Ventev 10-watt adapter (5 watts vs. 16.3 watts with the Ventev)The ipad 2 is identical to the Ventev 10-wattThe ipad 3 will charge slightly slower with the Ventev 10-watt adapter!Regarding your desktop or laptop computer USB port. At only 2.5-watt, it will take forever to charge your apple devices! Using your computer is the SLOWEST by far of charging any of your apple devices.Tip: always charge your ipad, iphone, etc. with the screen powered off since it draws power from the device. In the case of the computer USB port it really won't charge if the device is on since all of the 2.5-watt power (of the computer's usb port) will be going to the screen display.Also, as far as charge \"time\". In the case of the ipad, if you use the ipad charger that come with the device (12-watt) it will take about 3-1/2 hours to charge (divide the devices wattage by the wattage of the adapter/charger, i.e, 42-watt/12=3.5). If you use the Ventev charger (10-watt) it will take about 4.2 hours to charge (i.e., 42-watt/10=4.2)*Note: there seems to be some disagreement on the Internet about using an adapter with higher wattage than the devices wattage. In one place I read that it's okay to use an adapter of higher wattage than the device, but in another it could decrease the life of the battery (like using the 10-watt Ventev charger with the 7.1 watt iphone). I am not knowledgable enough to know the correct answer, so if there's any electrical engineers out there, please pipe in.That's my 101 on wattage and the Ventev adapter is a great addition to the all of the apple \"i\" products. I will use it for travel since it is a catch-all for both my iphone and ipad with not alot of wait time on the recharge, plus I can charge them both at the 10-watt speed, excellent!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Speedy Charging, 10-watt on each port.

If you're just now getting with the program, like me, OtterBox is a tough case for your iPhone. Getting one is simply an experience in itself. I've had experience with other cases and this doesn't come close to comparison.With the OtterBox, there's actually two cases. One is hard and comes with clear window for the touchscreen, which means there's no need for a screen protector. The second case is an outer soft cushion that's textured for better grip. It also protects the ports with flaps that sort of snap into place. Sounds weird since this is a soft texture, but that's what it feels like.Inside the box--actually printed on the inside, are assembling instructions that are easy to follow, but it's a no-brainer putting this together. Common sense will pretty much guide you through.After putting on the soft case, I noticed the hole of the earphone didn't line up. I thought this was a flaw until I visited their website. Here's what was posted:  \"Actually, the port cover is correct. The hole in the port cover is intended to leave open access for the noise-cancelling mic. To use headphones you need to open this port cover. This cover prevents dust and dirt from entering the device when the headphone jack is not in use.\"If you've never used an OtterBox, YouTube has so many bizarre demonstrations of iPhone users dropping their devices off houses, apartment complexes and buildings. One person even drop-kicked their iPhone a couple of times and the OtterBox held up and also defended the phone. I have no intention of doing anything that extreme.

The edges are rounded to make it look even slimmer and sleeker. However, this elegant design is somewhat marred by all the logos and printing on the back. Really ruins the overall look.

Most days I didn't need to charge my phone until I went to bed at night, but I definitely needed to charge at night.

One night, shortly after I got it, it was down to 30 or 40 percent when I was going to bed, so I played a graphics heavy game for a while, trying to kill it. After an hour of play, I backed out of the game to check my power level-- I had barely done any damage at all. Perhaps I should have tried downloading something at the same time.Yesterday I didn't use it much-- and I had it plugged in while I was using the navigation-- and 12 hours after leaving the house I was still at 100%. Any other phone I've had would have dropped some power in the interim, from processes and whatnot, but not this.Why all phones can't do this yet is beyond me.

Also, since Bluetooth can be temperamental, or erratic (especially with other Bluetooth-connected electronics devices in the near vicinity), a convenient audio cable is provided for a surefire connection between player and the Motorola speaker.The speaker is loud enough and should amplify the human voice sufficiently for efficient, unforced conversation.  But anyone who claims this speaker excells at musical reproduction simply has no use for bass frequencies, which for the most part are inaudible on the EQ5.  The Motorola EQ7, on the other hand, covers the entire frequency range, its four JBL speakers constructing a soundstage and providing a sense of life-like presence and vivid realism simply unequaled by any other bluetooth speaker.  Since the beginning of the year the EQ5 qppears to have more than doubled in price, making several other bluetooth speakers a better value--at least for anyone seeking full-frequencied music reproduction.

I have had performance problems with the Jabra Wave, Samsung, and some others; the Jawbone and an older Blue Ant model didn't fit me well.Good news: The Voyager Legend is even better than the Pro! The most important thing to know is that, as with the Pro, it works well, with good audio quality under all conditions. Callers never complain. That said:My negatives are all positives (!):- The biggest disadvantage is that it is fairly large, with the microphone on a longer boom than most headsets -- but that isalso anadvantage, as the long boom brings the mike closer to the mouth and seems to greatly improve audio quality.The on-ear balance is great, so the size does not bother me in the least.- A common complaint is the charging cable which is a non-standard magnetic connection rather than microUSB, as the Pro was. On one hand, it means that when I travel, I have to carry the cable. But the cable is short, so not a big deal -- and for most trips, the unit has enough charge capacity (7 hour talk, 11 day standby) that I would not even carry the cable.And now that I have used it, I greatly enjoy the convenience of snapping the headset into the magnetic connector. Easy.- Another common complaint is the short cable, but I like that (a lot). I see Plantronics offers a longer cable for $10 which is a microUSB cable with an adapter on the end that makes it work with the magnetic connector. See:Plantronics Voyager Legend microUSB AdapterPositives:- As I said, first and foremost is the excellent call quality both on my end and for the people I am calling. Bluetooth connectivity is also excellent and consistent. I think it's even better than the Pro.- Comfortable for me. I much prefer the over-the-ear design to headsets that rely on the in-ear fit.- I love the toggle-style on-off switch.- Connects effortlessly to phone and computer.- Sound seems louder and clearer- Controls have been relocated.

Buyer beware!** Review after ordering again and receiving it on 12/4 **After ordering it again, I got the cover and took a look at it.  One thing to remember about this cover there are only two positions you can watch videos in: The nearly flat position or upright.  For those that have had tri-fold covers in the past, this will be a slight disadvantage.The material is fairly good for synthetic leather, and its much lighter than leather.  I still have yet to receive my Kindle Fire 8.9\", so I can tell you how it fits.  But I can tell you there are cut-outs for the speakers and all the ports.  It does have a magnetic closure, which is an advantage over the elastic ones.As far as initial value, besides the slight bump with the original order, I would say this is going to be a pretty good value.  No its not leather, but it looks like it, and feels fairly close to it.  It is really light weight.  It has a pen with a stylus for the Fire on one end and an ink pen on the other.I'll update when I get the Fire 8.9 in a week.** After having it with the Fire for about a week 12/12 **I decided to pitch this case and have lowered my rating down to 2 stars.  The man-made leather is VERY slick, it easily can slip out of your hand - which sort of defeats the purpose - therefore there is no point to this case.  If they made it in all leather, it would be a winner.  Further the man-made material does not work well in the standing low position; it might as well be laying flat.

While I would have like to have had Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box like the Nexus has, I know a software update will come in time.  Anyways, I finally bit the bullet when I saw the phone on sale here on Amazon Wireless, so I grabbed it, and have used the savings to buy a dock on regular Amazon, plus an Otterbox case (which actually fits really well to the phone).The ordering process was pretty pain-free, though I had to \"submit\" my application a few times before it finally took.  I was surprised that I had two-day shipping; originally the phone was supposed to arrive via Lasership on the 16th, but to my surprise it arrived a day early on my doorstep!  Considering what I've heard about Lasership, I'll consider myself lucky.  The Droid box, SIM card, and bonus car charger (thanks Amazon!!) were all snuggly and securely packed, and the box was delivered in fabulous condition.Activating the phone was... Problematic.  Amazon Wireless tried at first to resubmit/activate my phone with Verizon, but apparently Verizon did not want to play well with Amazon.  The rep I talked to at Amazon, Emily, was extremely nice with me, and went out of her way to make sure I would still get the Amazon Wireless discount on my phone even if I had to go into a Verizon store to activate my phone.  Later in the evening I called Verizon Customer Service to get the phone activated, but they were no help and pawned me off onto the Telesales department, who also could not help me activate my phone and blamed the whole deal on Amazon Wireless.  So I called Amazon Wireless (at 10:30 at night!  These guys are awesome!), and Malachai listened to my situation and whooped some butt into gear at Verizon to get my phone activated for me.  You guys at Amazon Wireless deserve serious recognition for the awesomeness you all pull off every day!Once my phone was activated and it booted up, it was WOW!  The screen looks fantastic, Android OS is super-easy to navigate once you have the hang of it, and everything is organized in the logical and intuitive manner which iOS is not organized in.Now I've only been using the phone for a day, but here are my initial thoughts about the phone:Pros:-The screen is amazing.  It beats the crap out of the iPhone 3GS and iPad 1 screens in terms of brightness, depth, and ease on the eyes.  I would go as far as to say that it is almost a tablet-quality screen, but it fits in my pocket!-This phone is super fast!  Really this kind of speed/responsiveness is what I would expect in a bulky laptop, not a smartphone.-I absolutely love the \"smart actions\", and can't wait to play with them more!-This phone is built to take abuse, without a case on it.  The kevlar backing and gorilla glass are actually big selling points for me since I tend to be rough on small electronics.  Having a case and screen protector on it (the Otterbox in the Verizon Stores gives you both out of the box!) will just make it last longer in mint condition.-You have apps like Netflix, Kindle, and DocsToGo on the phone right out of the box.  I've maybe only downloaded four additional apps so far; you'd have to download all of those separately on an iPhone.-Once you experience data service (especially 4G) on Verizon, you will wonder why you did not get this phone (or a 4G phone in general) sooner.  It is like cable modem fast!-It is soooo much easier to move apps between screens on Android than iOS.-Price.  I got this phone during an Amazon Wireless sale for $40 with plan when it is normally $100.-Amazon Wireless customer service.  You guys rock!Cons:-Verizon customer service.  It seriously sucks.-This thing eats through battery like a hot knife through butter.  An hour of web-surfing on wifi will obliterate the battery; even leaving it uncharged over night will wear it down faster than my iPhone would wear down.-Maybe this is just the con of micro-USB charging, but this phone charges extremely slowly, much slower than the iPhone.-I know it will support the music files I have in iTunes, I'm just not sure how to get all of my music over just yet...-The web browser is different from Safari in several ways.  At least right now it appears that I cannot easily group bookmarks into certain categories or move easily between windows/tabs in Android as I can in iOS Safari.Overall my first impression is that this is a great Android phone for a disillusioned iPhone user to switch to.  Its great, really it is.  Just beware Verizon customer service.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Phone, Great Customer Service", "unixReviewTime": 1331856000, "reviewTime": "03 16, 2012"}

Right out of the box I was impressed with the look and feel.  It has a soft smooth almost velvet-like feel making it very comfortable to hang onto, it wont slip out of your hand when plugging devices into it.  It was fully charged in about 4 hours and it holds an amazing amount of charge.  It charged the dead battery on my HTC Evo LTE and my Kindle Fire BOTH at the same time in under 2-1/2 hours and it had only used about half of its charge.The IMP99D comes with several different adapters making it work for just about any device you have that needs charging.  It is simple to operate with just 1 on/off button (that you press and hold for 5 seconds to turn it on or off) and 3 charging ports; one port for charging the IMP99D and 2 output USB ports for charging your devices.  There are 4 neon blue LED lights that indicate how much charge there is remaining.  I really like the fact that the 2 USP ports and the charging port are all on the same side so that I can leave it in the protective cover while charging the IMP99D or charging my devices.After plugging a device into the IMP99D you have to press and hold the on/off switch for 5 seconds to initiate the charge.It is a little cumbersome having to carry the wall output plug with you instead of a standard USB plug but I can understand it with the juice that this little charger takes to charge up and the impressive charge capacity that it holds.The only negative experience that I have had with this super little charger is the first time I put it into the protective pouch and pulled the strings to close it, one of the little balls on the end of the string pulled off and I had to rethread the string and tie a bigger knot on the end.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best Little Super Charger", "unixReviewTime": 1348012800, "reviewTime": "09 19, 2012"}

A review of a Lumia phone is as much a rundown of the OS as it is an assessment of the hardware, so I'll start there.Windows Phone 7.5 (Mango) is pretty awesome. Live Tiles are the perfect compromise between Android's resource-intensive widgets and iOS's bland, sterile home screen. The OS has yet to crash on me, I'd wager to say it's the most stable and speedy mobile OS I've used so far. You have a little less control over background tasks than Android, but whatever WP7 is doing behind the scenes is working because the OS never hesitates, never stutters. I would take serious issue with Bing navigation, put simply, it's garbage. It actually asks you to tap on the screen to hear directions out loud! Which would be illegal while I drive in my locality! Thankfully, Nokia steps in there with Nokia Drive (which now stores maps locally), and that app is a godsend (though, has a few rough edges). In any case, the OS has been a dream and I think Microsoft has a winner on their hands. I've loved Metro since my Zune HD, and no exception here.As for the phone hardware, it's really well constructed. In terms of build quality, it takes me back to the days of the Nokia candy bar phones in that Nokia phones still seem indestructible. I've dropped the phone flat on its face a few times now with no issues. I really like the feel of the back of the phone as well, it's a soft-tough plastic (that feels a lot like Incipio's Feather cases), which makes it light but substantial all at once. But the hardware build also brings me to my one serious issue with the 710: The buttons. They really are THAT bad. First off, all three buttons are conjoined, meaning you never \"feel\" a solid click, as you're really once pressing 1/3 of a big button down. The button is also difficult to depress and is cramped down towards the bottom of the phone. The button is also so close to the bottom of the screen that you'll constantly get accidental screen-input. I'm really surprised that a company with Nokia's design lineage would make such a rookie mistake, but it's definitely an issue and a good reason to look at an 810 or 900.The Lumia line is a last grasp for relevance from two once-behemoths in the smart phone space. And from what I can gather in my short time with the Lumia 710, they have the product, now they just need the press and mind share. The really shocking thing is that this phone is a low-end Lumia phone! Button quality aside, never once did it feel like I was using a budget handset. Which begs the question: How awesome is the Lumia 900? I may need to find out sooner than later.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent, speedy phone marred only by the worst buttons on earth", "unixReviewTime": 1334188800, "reviewTime": "04 12, 2012"}

I must ask this question at least twice a week in exasperation to my gym buddies, my gamer pals and my coworkers.  But the fact remains, we're never truly wireless.I've tried a wide variety of bluetooth headset alternatives, all of which have had significant flaws.  The headsets with the wraparound headband either look absolutely ridiculous or sound like junk (or both).  The earbuds usually have some kind of gimmicky dongle or accessory attachment that merely shortens wires and makes the situation more awkward.  Or, they flat out don't work, don't chair and/or don't pair.None of these problems exist with these headphones-- finally! In fact, for me they are ALMOST perfect.  I want them to be perfect!The charging pouch, for me, was too goofy to use. It's very stiff and it's really tough to get the earbuds in and out.  So, I just tossed it in my electronics box and go without.  Otherwise, charging is simple and easy.  It would have been super if they went with a standard USB cable because I would have avoided yet another dangling appendage coming from my desktop.  But, oh well.  Small stuff.The headphones themselves are very nicely constructed and come with interchangeable earbud cones for varying ear sizes.  This is pretty typical for all earbuds.Pairing is a cinch.  Just press and hold the square button on the on-cord control dial.  Your iPhone (and, presumably your Android) smartphone will find it instantly.Sound quality is excellent (considering its wireless/bluetooth).  It's nice and loud.  Good depth, good treble.  Excellent and more than satisfactory!Now for my two gripes:1- The size of the earbuds themselves is 2-3 times the size of an Apple iTunes earbud.  They look huge and stick out horizontally from your ear canals and make you look pretty silly.  Plus, they are a bit heavy so they can fall out of your ear if they brush or catch something in your physical surroundings.2- The cord is stiff, inflexible and pulls the earbuds out even when you are walking in a straight line and otherwise not moving your upper body.

Also - I was worried about the rubberized green getting dirty, but it really doesn't.  Has been in my purse almost a month and it doesn't look dirty at all.Case fits well - you do have to make sure that the green half circles fit well into the cutouts in the black, but it's easy enough and it sits well after that.  Sits up well enough from the screen and camera to offer a bit of protection (on a flat surface they are a few mm away from touching anything)  Case does not interfere with the camera, speaker/microphone, input ports or buttons at all....all good since that's always the worst flaw of any case that does so.  Do wish there was some green showing around the camera lens just to complete the look...case see the shiny glass a bit of the flat black of the phone (you'd see a strip of white on a white iPhone, I suspect though can't confirm).  Minor detail though.  Nice even margins on the green otherwise. Fairly wide around the face (lots of green border).The Incipio case had the two side volume buttons in the same cutout in the hardcase...this one has the hard case actually wrap around and separate them.  I thought this might interfere with their use, but it really doesn't at all.And cases like this where you've got the rubber liner in the hardshell are popular for a reason - they protect the electronics well - against both shock and pointed/rough impacts and surfaces.On the whole I think it's nice.

After receiving the case and finding out that it really DID have all those issues, I decided I would live with it, just to keep the replacement safe. Now I'm rethinking that; I didn't know what 'watermarks' were until just yesterday, when a big spot appeared on the inner side of my case. I opened it up, only to find the mark was gone. So I cleaned the glass and closed the phone back up in the case. This morning the spot was back, and brought his friends. The single watermark from yesterday has gotten MUCH bigger and now several more smaller ones are present. My touch screen barely works around them, and the 'back' button at the lower right doesn't respond to any amount of coaxing.To be clear, the grid of dots doesn't bother me at all - I can't see them when I'm using my phone (I can only see them when my screen is black and I look at a certain angle). What irks me is that MULTIPLE watermarks form in spite of them (and degrade the performance of my device so much).I wrote this review on my S3 to get a better sense of how the watermarks affect text input.  Glad I did,  because when I started the review my intent was still to keep it despite the watermarks.

That's probably obvious to most people out there, but just like any other tablet, boot it up and connect to a WiFi network - then you're good to go. You have the option of connecting to an AT&T; HSPA+ or LTE network the same way you would any WiFi network, and when you do so it'll prompt you to activate the pre-installed SIM card. Otherwise, no monthly data plan required.Pros:- Screen is gorgeous. The 1920x1080 IPS display has magnificent viewing angles, the brightness is more than good enough for reading and browsing outdoors on a sunny day.- Performance screams! The Snapdragon 800 processor made me raise an eyebrow at first, but I suppose they went that route for the LTE capabilities. It's as good or better than any of the Intel counterparts. 1080p video plays perfectly without skipping a beat, games look great, screen animations and transitions are zippy and smooth.- The soft touch plastic the case is made from is great to hold. There's something to be said about the magnesium case of the Surface 2, or the anodized aluminum of the iPad air...but the plastic on the Lumia 2520 doesn't make it feel any less sturdy by any means. In fact, after using it for a couple days, I like it better than the Air.- Sound - I don't know where it comes from, but it's stereo, and it sounds as good as my MacBook Pro.- Battery Life is fantastic. The rated 11+ hours is dead to real. I spent an hour and half or more browsing the internet at 50% brightness with the battery at 7% before it told me to save my work and shutdown.Cons:- Windows RT. Nothing more needs to be said really. With RT you're limited to whatever apps you can find in the Windows Store, and it's slim pickins still years after release. Obviously the largest companies have really well designed apps that work as well as any other mobile OS's, but there aren't really any startups or independent software companies making good apps for this ecosystem. You don't even have to install a lot of apps to see that this is the case. The app icons in most cases are so severely lacking that you wouldn't even consider clicking on them to begin with.- Funny enough, the screen is also a con somewhat. For as gorgeous as it is overall, the one I received has really bad backlight bleeding on the right edge. On the bootup screen when it's entirely black, it's super obvious. When you reading in low light conditions it's also very obvious. I'm considering returning it because perhaps I just got a lemon.Other thoughts: I think the Lumia 2520 has a niche - and it fills it perfectly if this is what you're looking for. If you're always on the go and don't always have access to WiFi, or don't want to bother friends and family for their WEP/WPA passwords when you're at the their house, this tablet is great. Also, if you require access to Office applications on you tablet, the experience is second to none. If Windows RT will suffice for your needs, and you need a tablet with LTE, gorgeous screen, and great battery life, you can't do much better.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of the best RT Tablets out there!

Not surprisingly, given the low retail price, the Pure1 cannot compete with the Plantronics in voice reproduction, although other features can.  Voices are muted and distant sounding, although still clear, on both ends, and I find myself switching away from the Bluetooth to my iPhone if I'm in a position to hold the phone. It comes with a clear plastic ear hook, but I ditched that at once since, when I hook it around my ear, the actual earpiece is positioned too low.  By using this without the hook to place the headphone directly into my ear canal, I can hear, and, surprisingly, the earpiece stays in place.  Still, the voice reproduction isn't as clear as I'd like.  Don't even try to use this as a music listening device because the sound is just not good enough.Pairing and operation are easy, as they should be.  The pairing/power light is tiny, and I had trouble at first deciding whether the earpiece was on or off; however, once I located it, it was easy to read.  The detachable hook can be place for either right or left ear operation.  The rated talk time is 4 hours, and, while I haven't timed it, the estimate seems about right.This is a lightweight, budget earpiece that is best suited for occasional use.  If you use Bluetooth headsets a lot, you'll likely be frustrated as I was.

It just happens that this version is all-around good and the very few negatives don't amount to a lot.So here it is why I like this model:&#10004; GOOD CAPACITY AND YET NOT HUGE OR HEAVY: at 5600mAh it can charge a phone two or three times. Once you fill it up with juice you can simply drop it in your bag and it's ready to use when you need it.&#10004; COMES WITH ITS OWN CHARGER: most chargers on the market rely on you providing your own wall charger, which is not hard but, still, the one included is a welcome frill and it just happens to be smaller than most third party so I'm glad it's included.&#10004; INTERFACES GALORE: read Amazon's description but, just in case you don't want to bother, the iFLASH comes with a modular system that has a USB Type-A at one end and it allows you to attach any of the supplied interfaces at the other end such as Mini USB, Micro USB, PSP (true), Nokia DC 2.0, iPhone/iPad (old style) and, of course, you can supply your own wire if none of these fit your device.&#10004; COMES WITH A BAG: this is very important to me. The nice blue bag can easily hold the iFLASH, the wall charger and the few wires and plugs you may need.&#10004; CHARGE INDICATOR RING LIGHTS: they light up when you press a button and 4 blue rings mean 100% full, 3 rings mean 75% full and so forth.&#10004; LITTLE LED FLASHLIGHT: just in case. Who knows, you may find yourself in complete darkness and this just might save the day.Output is 5V/1A which should make it good for charging phones, not good for charging tablets or anything bigger.The design isn't going to win any prize at an industrial design competition but even the looks are quite decent. If you are looking for a charger that works well and comes with everything you need, this one is very good choice. I didn't measure how many minutes it took this iFLASH to charge my phones but charged it did and it did it quickly and, once all I needed was in the bag already I didn't have to waste time looking for little wires or plugs.The negatives may or may not matter. If you have no idea how to use a an external battery to charge your phone you may not want this model. Unless you can read Chinese. The unit I received came with a Chinese-only user guide.

The wind filtering is medium and it gets pretty windy here.#3 the audio itself is too low, I had to switch to the lowest size ear buds so they fit deeper in my ear canal.  Even then with my phone at max audio volume, and my Voyager Pro at max audio volume the audio is only \"just able to be heard\" I really wish it could have pushed the volume louder to account for people who talk with soft voices.  I have had over the head 2.5mm headphones that provide louder audio volumes.Overall, the Plantronics Voyager Pro isn't a bad product, but for as much as it costs you would expect it to have better volume and to include a foam covering for the microphone for people who may want to grow beards.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "No Beards is Right and Audio Level Low", "unixReviewTime": 1287100800, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2010"}

I was a little skeptical that it was making that much difference, so to check, I loaded a webpage. It loaded up quickly, so I figured why not try logging in remotely. Remote login requires a pretty solid connection and it cannot drop or it closes the connection. So I was really trusting this device to work.Well, it worked.

It was great at first but then over the last few weeks, the fingerprints got harder and harder to wipe off. When I first got it, fingerprints would wipe off pretty easily but I guess after time, you're also wiping the oleophobic coating off also. I loved the clarity but couldn't deal with the fingerprints anymore. So I read the reviews for the PhoneDevil Matte Clear sreen protector and decided to give it a shot. For the price, what could I lose.I got the package in 2 days - Amazon Prime :) and was a little nervous about all that I read about matte screens and how they ruin the great retina display. Installation was very easy. I've installed screen protectors many times so I think I have the hang of it. Using the tape trick to grab little dust particles is always helpful. After the install there were zero bubbles and it was a perfect fit. After about 1 week of use, I've gotten use to the matte coating. It does take some time but I actually like the look of it. It just looks clean. It does take away a little bit of the display brightness but it's hard to explain. I don't mind it at all. You can still see fingerprints but they aren't as obvious. For any of you that have a clear protector or don't have one at all know how the fingerprints can be pretty nasty. With the PhoneDevil matte protector, those fingerprints don't show up the same way. That's also a bit hard to explain. You should really just try it out especially if the fingerprints kill you everyday. But do keep in mind that the matte display will take some getting used to or you'll either love it or hate it.

Contrary to other reviewers, I have a pretty comfortable fit. Pairing is also very easy. I like the button placement etc. I had it paired with both my laptop and a iPod nano wireless transmitter (i10s (Luxurious White) Tiny Bluetooth iPod Transmitter for iPod/iPhone/iPad/iTouch).I have a couple other Bluetooth headphones but they were not suitable for active sports. While this one does better job of staying on my head, there is a big annoying problem with signal cut-offs. S9-HD frequently loose signal with the transmitter. I cannot keep the iPod reliably in my pocket. I have to hold it in my hand. I thought the issue was with my wireless transmitter but these headphones do the same with my laptop when I am sitting directly in front of the laptop and also my other Bluetooth headphones do not cut-off this frequently, at such a short distance.Edit: The cut-offs seems to be less when both iPod and S9-HD are fully charged. When battery starts to drain over time (say an hour or so) the cut-offs become more often. Either the battery is too small or not fully charging fully (or both). Perhaps, with a few more charge/discharge cycles the situation may improve. I'll update this review if I see an improvement.Edit2: The cut-offs are continuing after over a month use. It is such an annoyance and probably a flaw of this device as my other bluetooth devices does not have this problem.

The other is a 1,000mAh Duracell. Obviously, it will not work for a 12 hr flight and 2 devices. I needed something with more juice.I choose this model over other New Trent products because of the price and price/mAh. They have one that outputs 11,000mAh, but was outside my price point.The other model I considered was the  IMP70D 7,000mAh. I choose to go with the IMP880 because it had more juice. The main thing the IMP70D has over the IMP880 is dual usb output.Now with the review of the IMP880.Pros: 1) sleek looking.2) built well.3) auto shut-off - you can leave your device connected to it and it automatically shuts off when your device is fully charged.4) smart turn-on - meaning you must have a device connected to it in order to turn it on. You cannot accidentally turn it on.Cons: 1) I am only getting 6700mAh of charge. Not 8900mAh.  I figured this output based on charging my iPhone 4 using the % remaining battery indicator. The iPhone 4 has a 1420 mAh battery, according to cnet. [...] I was able to recharge my iPhone 4.7x and 5x. That would equate to 6,600mAh and 7,100mAh. I ran this test twice, and got about the same results.A few things that could make device better:1) increase surface area, and make device thinner. The device is not huge, but it is too bulky to carry in a pants pocket. It's about 2x as thick as my wallet, about the same surface area.2) a digital output of % remaining or mAh remaining vs the blue line that symbolizes 100%/75%/50%/25%3) charger for device could be smaller. The charger is about 1/2 the size of the battery. It would be nice if you could charge it with a USB like an iPhone or EVO.Overall, nice device...3 stars because of the 6,600mAh and 7,100mAh output when it says 8900mAh.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;EDIT>>>>>>I was originally a bit upset with the product because I thought I was being \"shorted\"  1900mAh or so; however, after reading the Technical Details for the IMP99D, I feel like I prematurely judged the product.  The IMP99D is 9900mAh vs the 8900mAh one I bought.  The technical details say: \"Ultra reliable Lithium-Ion battery with 9900mAh, 500% iPhone 4 Battery life\" - well, on my 8900mAh one I got 4.7-5x charges on my iPhone4. I also talked New Trent's customers service and they said storage does not equate to output. My point is: well, my charger works just fine.5 stars... upgrading to 5 stars from 3 stars because device works as advertised.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "nice,  after better understanding the product &lt;review edited>", "unixReviewTime": 1317340800, "reviewTime": "09 30, 2011"}

I've used Palm, Blackberry, WinMobile, Webos, Ios, Meego, WP7 and Android. So I know the differences. Having used many of them, I have made Android my primary phone. The reasons for me are simple - I like to be in charge of my device. Customization is a choice, it is not mandatory. Many iphone owners will say oh you have to tweak your Android phone to make it useful. Nothing can be further from truth. It is entirely up to the user. There are many cool things you can do with Android that you never can on any iphone.- A proper file manager/USB storage: what is it and why it matters? If you used any USB flash drive, you know how it works. You just plug it in and it shows up as a drive and you can drag and drop ANY file in it. Android works the same way. There is no special itunes/zune-like software you need to manage your phone. It's sad that Apple charges so much for higher capacity iphones yet the storage can not be managed in any way YOU please. It's strictly designed to be a consume devices - music and video.- \"AirDroid\" - simple and free app for Android that allows you to do nearly everything from a browser interface without even touching your phone. this includes file transfer, app management, send/receive txts and much more. this is very convenient because you can have your phone in your pocket.- \"mysms\" or \"mighty text\" - these are also handy as they allow you to send/receive sms without even touching your phone as long as your phone has working signal. pretty awesome in office environment.Mind you, 90% of Android customization can be done by anyone irrespective of tech knowledge. There is no rooting(aka jailbreaking in Ios world) needed. Iphone users will tell you once you jailbreak an iphone, it can be made to work like Android. Again that's completely false. Jailbreaking idevice allows a little customization but it's nowhere near Android. And you still can't do anything you want. For instance- you still can't properly manage that storage on your idevice even after jailbreaking. Because jailbreaking doesn't change the core OS or how it behaves.Pros:Great battery life. Charges pretty fast. Mine charges fully in roughly about an hour.Highly portable. very lightweight.Openness + Customization of Android.Better reception - I've tried using my SIM card on my LG phone which drops signal but Sony was able to retain at least one bar.Stylish - sure it's not made of aluminum but still looks and feels great on hand.Cons:No expandable storage. Again if you are a light user, it should not bother you. Mind you all iphones never offered expandable storage yet they are very popular. So it really depends on your usage. I'm a heavy user and for me, the device must be flexible. And this is the only con I can mention about this device.Final words about Android. As Android is platform agnostic, you will find low end to high end Android device. You can't really judge an OS by using a crappy Android device. Xperia U is above average/mid-range phone. It's of course unlocked so you can use AT&t; 3G in the usa and worlwide.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Freedom and customization of Android", "unixReviewTime": 1352419200, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2012"}

Before I acquired the iPhone 5S I was using the Samsung Galaxy S4.  One of the many accessories I missed was the wireless charging capabilities the Galaxy S4 had.  You also were able to choose from so many different covers and cases that worked with the Qi receiver (wireless charging pad).  I checked what was out in the market for the iPhone 5 but nothing seemed to really \"fit\" what I was looking for until I had the opportunity to test the Unu Aero Wireless Charging Case and Pad.The case itself is soft to the touch and comes it two separate pieces.  It does a tiny bit of bulk and weight to the phone, but not too much to make much of a difference.  The case has raised buttons for the volume and power controls.  However, it has an open area for the mute switch.  Even though it does not have an open area in the bottom for the speakers, it  has two slots located on the front of the case for sound and microphone use.  The camera cutout on the back is quite large, so expect no interference troubles there.The receiver (Qi) pad is extremely lightweight and automatically begins charging you phone as soon as it makes connect with your phone.  Believe it or not, this charges faster the normal lightning cable.  I was so impressed with how fast it charges and how long it holds the charge, I ended up acquiring two additional charging pads to have in my office and another in my vehicle instead of using a lightning cable.  Keep in mind besides using the wireless pad to charge the phone,  you can always a  micro USB cable to charge the case as well in case of emergencies.  The only thing you really need to get use to is using a headset extension adapter.  Since the headphone jack sits far into case, a headphone plug will not be able to fit correctly.  I don't use the same headsets all the time, so I have to make it a point to remember to carry the included headphone jack adapter with me when I plan to use different headphones.One really great feature is the battery usage indicator located on the back of the case.  It has four tiny blue lights to tell you how much battery life is left.  It is pretty accurate too because I have the battery indicator on my phone and I am always comparing the two.When using it to sync to iTunes, you just need to use a micro USB cable instead of the Apple Lightning cable.  This way you don't have to take the case off.This is truly a terrific product and works great.  If you are interested in extra pads here is the link:uNu Aero Series Wireless Charging Pad (Single Mat). Like I mentioned before, I used one in my vehicle by placing it in one of the cubbyholes in my Dogde Durango - works great!UPDATE:Since I kept taking the case on and off to test and review other cases on my phone, I broke one of the tabs on my uNu Aero case and wanted to cry because this is my favorite and pretty much the case I use everyday.

I was somewhat concerned after reading some of the negative reviews but I can honestly say connectivity and clarity have not been a problem at all for me. I am using it with my iPhone 4S. First thing I should mention that is packed and presently nicely in a very thick plastic box. The instruction book is extremely thick, but it comes in 10 different languages and the actual instructions to follow are only about 20 pages and that includes pictures. Comes with 4 types of multi country AC adapters in case you travel to foreign countries that use different type of voltage plugs. Two universal dock adapters and a Micro-USB/USB cable if you wish to charge the unit via your computer.The base has some weight to it and will sit securely in place. I got the soft Black Touch which is like a soft rubber and it feels soft and silky smooth and can easily be wiped cleaned. It stated in the handbook that it takes about 2 to 3 hours to charge the unit 100%, but it took about 1  until the white LED turned off telling me the handset was completely charged. Paring was a breeze - just press the MFB button for 2 seconds on the handset and go to your bluetooth menu on your iPhone. My iPhone found it and paired with the MM03i automatically with no code. You actually can program up to 4 Bluetooth devices according to the instructions, but it will only automatically reconnect the last devices connected in its memory.I use a case with my iPhone and do not like the idea of removing it. My phone fit perfectly fine in it's case and I had no connection issues if I used the base without a dock adapter. Using the \"+\" , \"-\" and \"MFB\" buttons pretty much allow you to use all the functions as you would on your iPhone. You can reject a call, control the volume, hold a call, redial last number call and even use voice command. I use Siri a lot and all you have to do is hold the \"+\" button for two sections and she will pop up and await your instruction.You also can choose a different ringtone. There are a total of 15 in all. Since I am using the handset in office, I set the volume at the lowest possible setting because some of the ringtones can ring quite loudly. In regards to clarity, I have had no complaints. Callers have heard me clearly and I have heard them fine. The handset feels comfortably against my ear and there is no hand or ear fatigue.I would like to mention that in the instructions it states the MM03i enables Bluetooth connection with any laptop, desktop (Mac or PC) to work with Skype, Google Talk or other VOIP services. I don't have Bluetooth Wireless Technology on my PC, but I thought it might be important to mention.The only negative feature is that it is hard to tell the difference between the receiver and earpiece, the both look identical. I would try to answer a call holding the wrong end to my ear. Sometimes instead of thinking the unit is charging I come to found out I put the wrong end where it is suppose to charge. Even though is will not sit perfectly flush when the right end is not in the right hole, it would have been nice to have some kind of marking showing the top of the handset.Overall this is a really neat product for Smartphone users. It is has the benefits of ergonomics and comfort-ability of old school phones but introduces Bluetooth Technology into the mix. Also makes a unique gift if you know someone who loves to gab!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Old school meets new school", "unixReviewTime": 1337817600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2012"}

It protects the phone really well in the leather case.  The inside is soft.  At first I thought it would be awkward in the horizontal position on my belt but on the contrary, it does not get stuck when I bend over or stoop down and the clip for the belt is nice an tight so it does not push up and fall off when you bend down like other do.  The magnetic flap is also a really nice touch. It is also very easy to take out when the phone rings.  Just flip up  the flap and push you finger from the bottom thru the holes in the case and it pops right up.  Puting it back in is just as easy.Remember that if you use a case it may not fit in this case as it is meant to be used with just the iphone by itself.

They work very nicely together and look awesome.  They protect the iphone without adding extra bulk and allow the natural look of the iphone to shine thru.  The only negative is that the case will not protect the iphone as well as a completly enclosed rubber type should you drop it on pavement.Low profile snap on case:[..]Front Screen protector:This works the best as it has both a front and back peel off layer to help you install it well.

A+ for presentation and could be a very good gift for someone special. Unit came pre-charged but follow instructions... charge it for a minute or so before use. After that, it's as simple as plug it in. Fast charged my HTC EVO 4G from almost empty to full in a very short time... sorry forgot to time the charging time because I was overly excited over this new toy. After that I charged it using an AC-USB charger until all 5 green LED's are lit. Concept: Neat and Concise. The battery extender could also be charged by a computer via its USB cable. Then the same USB cable could be flipped over to charge the phone; in my case, I had to use an additional mini USB to micro USB charging adapter. So 1 cable, 1 bat-ext, 1 adapter, all in a single pouch. A+ for compact. A+ for simplicity and nice touch on the little status button that tells you how much juice is left. Industrial Design: Clean line and 'Apple' like although the enclosure squeaks a little when it's being squeeze. And because of the shining effect, expect fingerprints magnet! Buff the prints off using the soft case, and it looks marvelous! Overall, well built and no gap, which show excellent workmanship and attention to details. Markings are sharp and no blemish found. Don't know about how safe it is as there is no UL Listing Mark on it; could be a concern for a rechargeable Li-Ion battery, which is known to go 'Kaboom' when being over-charged. Has some weight feel to it...feel like it's stocky! Good, I am expecting beefy juice out of this bad boy!Since it's full charge 8 days ago, it now has lost one green LED without being used. Assuming that the unit discharges linearly, it would take 8*5=40 days to completely discharge... Recognizing that this a false assumption and theoretically at best, so don't go jumping all over me now! I will give the unit another 8 days to check if it would lose another LED. Then loading and cycling tests of the unit will begin. Stay tune.Update Jan 2013 - After 2 years of using this device, it has paid for itself many times over. The battery appears to reach it's life cycle so I have to charge it more often to ensure I have backup power while traveling. It's still a nice unit when it was introduced at the time... simple to use, just remember to plug it in the night before your trip to have a full charge ready for use.... today there are many similar options to choose from other companies, and there are newer models from the same company... worth a second look.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very Neat Little Power Brick", "unixReviewTime": 1291680000, "reviewTime": "12 7, 2010"}

However, this one has some excellent features that many of the generic ones lack.What sets this apart from the other two-port chargers is the intelligent electrical protection. It has current overload protection like many other higher end chargers, but also detects overheating. Another safeguard that this has that many other chargers lack is when your device is fully charged the charger kicks down into minimal charging mode. That feature will help to extend your battery life, which for me in important because I own an iPad and a Samsung Tab 3, both of which have sealed internal batteries.The two ports on this charger are rated at 1 and 2.1 Amps respectively. The 2.1 Amp port charges my tablets as quickly as the OEM chargers that came with them, so I trust the claimed specs.Other features that I love are the fact that this is a sealed unit, so the electrical components are not exposed to the salt air near where I live. What I mean by that is other chargers, and especially generic ones, can be disassembled by unscrewing the contact tip. This is supposed to allow you to change out an internal fuse if it fails. Most of the quality chargers - like this one - now feature a completely sealed design with the more sophisticated electrical protections that I mentioned.Finally, this is compact at 1.2 x 2.4 inches.

When the package arrived, I quickly opened it and attached my iPhone to the Kensington SoundWave.  Immediately, I knew my first impression was wrong.The Kensington SoundWave sound amplifying car mount doubles the iPhone 4's volume without any battery drain.  The package contains both window and A/C vent mounts for selecting your vehicle's best option.  Flexible arms on the pivoting cradle allow for easy insertion or removal, while keeping the iPhone securely in place.  The cradle is also designed to allow the charging cable (not included) to stay connected during use.While the sound is significantly amplified, there is a small amount of distortion.  Some of the base is lost, resulting in a slightly tinnier sound.  However, this is the extent of the distortion as there is no additional grain or fuzziness caused by the amplification.In states like CA or MN, using the window mount may be illegal.  In these cases, using the simple to install A/C vent mount is advised.  Two spring locking vent arms on the top are pushed into the venting, while a third bottom bracket uses the mounting's weight to stabilize the A/C vent mount.  The cradle is snapped onto the mount and is ready for use.  The location of the mounted iPhone facilitates use for hands free applications such as using the phone on speakerphone or following a GPS navigation application's (application sold separately) directions.If you're looking for an inexpensive iPhone 4 car mounting bracket, the Kensington SoundWave mounting system is a worthy option with the advantage of amplified sound.

It measures 1 13/16&#34; x 2 1/4&#34; x 1 1/8&#34;, and weighs 2.4 ounces. It easily fits in a pocket, and I can pretty much palm the whole thing in my hand.

There is a little bit of a gap between the seams, but nothing major.* I was able to charge an iPhone4 and iPad3, and charging times seemed comparable to what I get with an Apple supplied charger. I charged both units at the same time, but didn't check to see if the total charge time slowed down.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The markings identifying the capacity of the power ports can be a little hard to read, especially in dim light.* As with all fold-in plugs, these are a likely first failure point. There is a cost for the convenience of not impaling yourself with the plug when you dig in your bag.=== Summary ===For a small form factor charger, I like it.

There are many knockoffs and fakes (complete with Apple wording on the back) so I am glad Amazon now offers this themselves. I saved about $5 vs. an Apple Store and shipping was free.I thought all chargers were pretty much the same, until I read a detailed technical article which both tested and disassembled chargers from several name-brand companies as well as some knock-offs/fakes. Apparently the Apple has the \"cleanest\" power output of any phone charger, including those from such excellent rival companies as Samsung (only an HP tablet charger was rated higher). This same article also lambasts Apple for charging $29.95 for the classic cube charger - but you may have noticed that the Apple Store price is now just $19.95 and the Amazon price is even $5 less. So for the revised pricing, this charger imho is a \"best buy\".Note that this is rated to put out 5 watts, but tested as putting out 6 watts, 20% more. In addition, most chargers delivered less power as they came closer to full charge, but the Apple continued to deliver more power. Although reviewers note that this compact cube charger only puts out half as much power as an iPad charger (even less than the increased 12 watt output on the iPad 4 charger), I have easily charged an iPad 2, in sleep mode, with my 5W Apple cube charger. It really puts out! Charging times are naturally longer, and you WON'T be charging an iPad 3 or 4 while playing a power hungry game - you will barely stay even with the power consumption - but if you can accept the longer charging times, the Apple cube charger WILL work.I was hauling around a 12 watt iPad 4 charger for all my Apple (and non-Apple!) charging needs, until I read the article and realized I wasn't overloading the Apple cube charger by using it to charge bigger devices than the phone, Touch, and Mini devices it was designed for. It charges at half the rate on larger devices, but for travel that still means even an iPad charges up overnight. I also use the Apple cube now on my Google Nexus 4 phone etc. simply due to the higher quality of the power output. I haven't noticed any slowdown in charge time on non-Apple devices.I will link to the power charger reviews in the comments section.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazon's is a REAL Apple charger & the Apple charger provides one of the cleanest outputs", "unixReviewTime": 1363737600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2013"}

In fact, based on what I had read in the other reviews I would actually say that it works better than advertised. The suction cup works so well that the only thing I can figure is that the person that had problems with it did not understand how it worked. It is not the standard type of suction cup where you simply press it against the windshield and hope it holds. This suction cup works by placing it against the windshield and then turning the knob counterclockwise in order to pull the center portion away from the windshield. As it does this it creates a vacuum seal that so tight that you are more likely to dislodge the windshield than you are to remove this device from it.The iPhone fits perfectly into the holder and the aux cable is nice and thin. I actually used the phone in this setup when I wanted to have a conference call and the other person's voice coming out of the car stereo worked great for that purpose.The only caveat I would list is that if your car has a long sloping windshield you may find the extension not quite long enough to bring the phone within reach. You may be able to compensate for this by mounting it up higher. I drive a Jeep Wrangler and it has a pretty vertical windshield so I don't have this problem.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely Excellent Product", "unixReviewTime": 1227139200, "reviewTime": "11 20, 2008"}
{"reviewerID": "A2EKBJB8H5MDD8", "asin": "B00E2TT8W6", "reviewerName": "Cenile D. Mentia", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "A common issue I've had with most external battery packs is that you never know how much juice is left inside-but this one fixes that problem with the simple solution of adding a small digital screen that tells you the percent of battery remaining. This 10000mAh battery pack is a well designed battery that would surely be useful to anyone who finds themselves running low on their smartphone batteries midway throughout the day. That being said, there are a couple of flaws with it that one might want to take note of.First off, the design-it's around the size of a typical wallet, and it's heavy enough that it would be uncomfortable to carry around in your jeans, but light enough that you wouldn't feel it in a bag. The entire battery is enclosed in a plastic shell, and there's only one power button, which you can press to turn on the device, or double press to turn on the flashlight. There are two USB out ports and one micro-USB input port for charging the battery itself, as well as a simple screen which displays the percentage of battery remaining. It also came with a charging cable with interchangeable plugs (for iOS devices & Micro-USB), and a nice handy travel bag. All of the above work well except for the screen which I found to have poor viewing angles. You have to look at it from a slight slant for the text to be clear. Nevertheless, this is only a small issue I have, and since the screen only displays the battery percentage, it doesn't matter too much.Onto the battery itself, it has a 10000mAh capacity-which should be able to recharge a phone multiple times. After a week or so of testing, it was able to charge my Nexus 4 phone around 3 times before I had to recharge the battery itself. This battery pack will definitely last long enough for most extended trips, and it's also great for people with multiple devices. One note though, is that it does take quite a while to recharge the battery. It took me around 8 hours to fully recharge it from 0-100%, so one does have to plan ahead.Overall, I really love this battery pack. I think it's just portable enough and it's large capacity allows it to last me around a week before I have to recharge it. That alone makes it quite convenient. I can just throw it in my bag and not ever worry about running out of battery. One thing I didn't mention much about was the flashlight, and that's because it's really just an average flashlight. It's not that bright, but it works. I suppose in some situations it might be useful to have, but I personally don't think it's necessary. I'd recommend this item for people who struggle with battery issues on the smartphones we use so heavily these days. There might be a couple flaws with this product, but it's still a very solid product for its price.SUMMARY==The Good==- Well constructed- Large capacity battery- Display shows % of battery remaining- 2 USB ports to charge multiple devices- Comes with a flexible charging cable capable of charging just about any device==The Not-So-Good==- Takes a while to charge- Screen has poor viewing anglesFeel free to ask any questions in the comment section below!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The battery pack I've been waiting for", "unixReviewTime": 1396051200, "reviewTime": "03 29, 2014"}

There's no creaking or flexing here.*Bluetooth audio on voice calls and music is probably the best I've experienced.Things the Galaxy S5 Does Acceptably:*The camera quality is decent, but macro photos are exceedingly difficult to take, and taking a picture of something lit (a sign, LED/LCD panel, et cetera) causes the focus to go nuts.*Micro/Mini USB cables aren't going to work with the USB 3.0 interface, but it uses a standard USB 3.0 cable.*TouchWiz is dramatically improved, but after a few hours, I went back to Nova Launcher. (Seriously, Samsung... I don't understand why you think the sanctity of your product is violated by my desire to move the Applications button from the right to the center.)Things the Galaxy S6 Can Improve On:*While the camera quality is decent, it doesn't hold a candle to the iPhone 5S in terms of convenience.*The plastic feels nice, but it's still plastic. It's time to use better materials.*It's at the very edge of what you could use with one hand. Yes, I get \"Bigger phones are the trend!\" So were Walkmans.*As heavily as Samsung wants enterprise clients moving to their devices, they've continually overlooked simple features, like a physical \"silent mode\" button.*To date, the AT&T; version of this phone has a locked bootloader, which seriously limits your ability to customize the phone.*The current implementation of fingerprint scanning isn't acting as a surrogate for a PIN or password (as it does on the iPhone 5S). This means that if you're connecting this to an Exchange server, and the admin hasn't enabled biometrics in the security policy, you'll be forced to use a PIN to unlock the phone.So, is it better than the HTC One M8? Maybe. Personally, I like the way it feels, and how the current iteration of TouchWiz is closer to the stock Google Play Edition. And again, the \"one hand mode\" is a godsend. On the other hand, the M8 looks every bit as expensive as it costs.Personally, I matched my S5 with a Galaxy Gear Neo, and they're great together. If you're willing to buy in to Samsung's ecosystem, the choice is much simpler.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Lots of benefits. Lots of shortcomings.

The case effectively protects the entire phone and all of its ports, completely encasing the phone in its protective shell.The design is very attractive. The black case looks good even on my gold iPhone. The glossy portions of the case have maintained their gloss, and don&#8217;t appear to scratch very easily.The case provides very good drop and impact protection while adding very little bulk. I switched from a spigen slim armor case which was even slimmer, but this New Trent case offers more complete protection with the built-in screen protector and port covers.Additionally, the case still gives access to the TouchID on the home button even though it is protected. The unit I tested seemed to have a slight manufacturing flaw in this part, but it did not impact usability.I have greater peace of mind with this case on my iPhone than I have had with any other case that I have used. Anyone who is looking for a case that has just the right ratio of protection to minimal bulk, this is the absolute best case I have found.Overall, I would give this product 5 stars.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Unique case, great protection", "unixReviewTime": 1395878400, "reviewTime": "03 27, 2014"}

All those new devices have the new(ish) Lightning connector, so a whole new generation of those add-ons is growing.  Ok, yeah, as an Android user, I do get a little jealous.  But anyhow, everyone needs a charging cable, right?

Nifty enough, but does it work?  To find out, I borrowed a pair of iPhones, a iPad, and an iPad Mini.  As I pretty much expected, the cable performed it's job just fine across all four devices.  And also as expected, given Zeetron's own admission to it, proper fit with cases was a variable.  The housing at the tip is just a little too fat for the opening in some cases.  That leaves a few choices - skip this cable, remove the case for charging, get a different case, or modify the case you have so the cable will fit.  I know which I would do (modify), but not everyone is going to be up for that.  As a unit, the cable is solidly made, and I have no concerns over its longevity and ability to take some abuse.

First and foremost, it performs superbly. The conductive mesh tip is picked up by my tablet every time I place it against the screen with no lag time to start sensing it. The tip is actually squishy, which I didn't expect since most of the conductive rubber-tipped styli I've used in the past had hard tips. This was a nice surprise, as it means using the stylus is a much more fluid feeling activity where slightly pressing or easing up on the stylus doesn't mean it leaves the screen. It also means this stylus doesn't make that awful tapping noise as you write, draw, or play games with it compared to most. It's almost dead-silent to use.Secondly, I really like the look of this pen. The two-tone color scheme gives it a really professional look, and the clip is functional as well as making it look like a higher-class writing device than your standard run-of-the-mill no-name stylus.And last but not least, I like the size of this stylus and the included ballpoint pen feature. The newest version of this stylus is a little longer than its original incarnation. It's still shorter than a standard ballpoint pen, but it's just write for carrying along with a tablet, and it's very comfortable to use both as a stylus and as a pen. The pen itself hides away with a twist of the pen, and the ink is easily refilled by pulling off the end of the pen and inserting a newIMP62R pen refill. Writing with the pen did take a moment to get used to, as the pen doesn't stick out very far from the stylus' rounded end, but after a few moments I found myself not even thinking about it.Extremely happy with this product, especially for the price paid ($8.95) and the fact that New Trent often runs Buy 1, Get 1 Free promotions on this item.

I couldn't live without it and don't plan on upgrading to another iPhone anytime soon.  They are too expensive.  I have grown much attached to the pair of wired earbuds that came with my iPhone.  The earbuds are one size fits all and are extremely comfortable to wear; I don't have to worry about gels falling off or getting stuck in my ear, and the microphone and controller work great.  Unfortunately, the wires can become very tangled and may take up to five minutes to untangle.  This can become annoying, especially when I am preparing for a long, leisurely walk.Afraid that I might lose the wired earbuds that came with my iPhone 4, I requested from the Amazon Vine Program the TYLT TUNZ Stereo Headphones.  It has six pairs of gels: 3 sizes (S, M, and L) of Comfort Gels and 3 sizes of Active Gels.  The Active Gels have plastic fins that fit securely in your ear.  Believe me; you will need extra pairs of these gels.  Having reviewed numerous wired earbuds in the past, I've learned that after two to six months of constant use, the gels have a tendency to fall off.  Sometimes they have gotten lost in my car.  Other times, they have become stuck in my ear canal and I've had to carefully pull them out; this always scares me.  This is why I always prefer the one-size-fits-all earbuds.The medium-size Comfort gels were already installed on the TYLT TUNZ earbuds when they arrived in their lime green protective packaging.  I didn't bother removing the gels.  Once removed, the integrity of the gels will have been compromised.  In other words, they won't fit as securely the next time I attempt to install them.  The medium-size gels fit comfortably inside my ear.  They never fell out while I walked, jogged or cleaned my apartment when wearing the earbuds.  Operating the earbuds is very basic.  I didn't even have to look at the short, easy-to-read manual.  The controller allows you to pause a song or answer a telephone call with one click, skip to the next song with two QUICK clicks, and back up to the previous song with three QUICK clicks.  Unfortunately, the controller doesn't have a volume control like the earbuds that came with my iPhone 4.The small manual, the limited one-year warranty, all six pairs of gels, the cable clip, and the earbuds can all be squeezed into a tiny black bag.  The bag reminds me of the rubber change purse that my dad still has.  When it is firmly squeezed, the mouth of the purse opens up.  The bag that came with the TYLT TUNZ is solid black with some lime green writing and is made of sleek, rubbery plastic.  I tossed it inside my gym bag, which has a black interior, and had a terrible time trying to locate it.  Lately, I've been keeping the small bag inside the lime-green box in which it arrived.  I can't lose it now.The wires are very thick and flat.  I've had other earbuds with flat wires that didn't tangle but the wires on the TYLT TUNZ earbuds are the thickest that I've ever seen.  They don't tangle and frustrate me, nearly giving me a heart attack, like the earbuds that came with my iPhone 4.  However, the earbuds aren't marked L or R for left and right ears, respectively, like other pairs of earbuds I've owned.  I just assume the wire that has the controller goes in my right ear; this has been the case with the other earbuds, both wired and wireless.The lack of a volume control and the fact that the sound quality is average or a little above average prevent me from giving the TYLT TUNZ wired earbuds the highest rating.  If it was less expensive, I would have given it five stars.  However, the price is approaching that of the more expensive wireless earbuds.  (Normally, I don't wear wireless earbuds because they are not worth the hassle of keeping them charged, always fall out of my ears and/or have poor sound quality.)  Overall, I don't find the TYLT TUNZ earbuds an adequate replacement for the earbuds that came with my Apple iPhone 4.  My search continues.Joseph B.

The reason I say that it is a must for traveling is because you can plug it into either a 120 V outlet or a 240 V outlet. In America, all outlets are 120 V, so you do not have to worry when you plug your Apple charger into the wall. However, when you travel, you may encounter countries that run 240 V electricity in their outlets. If you plug your Apple charger into one of these, you will fry your phone. Getting an outlet adapter will not solve this problem, even though you will have to do this anyway. You also need a charger that will step down the voltage from 240 V to 120 V in order to charge your devices. That is what this charger does, and using it while you travel will make it safe to charge your i-devices and android devices.The first one that I bought was defective.

I found the bass (typically where ear buds fall short) to be barely sufficient.  The price point was good on these - I don't treat my earbuds very well and am not about to spend a lot of money on something that is likely to get stepped on, left on an airplane, etc.If you want good sound quality you really need to get the over the ear headphones with the larger drivers, and you'll probably need to go to at least 320 bps on your MP3's or switch to a less lossy format.The microphone is quite small - almost unnoticible.

Carpenter", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "There was a lot to be excited about with this case: decent form factor, nice materials, front speaker deflectors, 2-piece slide apart construction and price. Unfortunately this case has two huge flaws and I regret the purchase.First, unlike every other case I've seen this case does not require you to press-to-hold the power button to turn it on and off. It turns on and off with any brief touch of the button. That means in your pocket or in your bag, or just picking it up wrong, anything that touches the button can turn the case on or off. I don't need to be constantly worrying about whether something hit the button when I need my phone to be charging.The second issue is the 500mA charging current. Simply stated you can not use your phone while charging from the case and expect your case to improve the charging level of your phone. Your phone will lose ground, albeit slower than without a charge at all but it will loose ground.This means if you want to build your phone  charge back up you have to strategically time the use of the case to ensure your phone hasn't gone down too much so you can still recover the charge but use the device at the same time.In summary this case requires entirely too much babysitting and thinking.

I've got desk drawers filled with basic Bicballpoints, Pilot Razor Points, Pentel Rollerballs, Magic Markers.I've got a sleek black lacquer Waterman ballpoint that someone gaveme as a birthday gift. I've got an elegant Montblanc Meisterstuckthat I save for really important occasions, like signing divorcepapers.I like pens. So when I bought myself a Nook HD tablet anddiscovered that my fingertip was about as accurate on a smallcapacitive screen as the tip of a baseball bat, and that it was alsoleaving behind, all over the screen, a greasy fog of unsightlyprints, I decided I needed a pen for the Nook. A stylus.So I bought a stylus that was very handsome, long and slim, witha cute little bulbous grey rubber tip. It was an improvement on myfinger. No prints. A bit more accuracy. But sometimes the rubbertip would collapse onto itself, catch on the glass, and then sort ofstutter across it. Sometimes, probably because I was pressing downtoo hard, it would actually jam up on me, and the software would stopscrolling.Then I got the New Trent stylus. It's slightly smaller than thefirst stylus, and maybe not quite so handsome. It's slightlythicker, too, but it fits as well as the first one did into theelastic band on my tablet cover. And, more important, it fits intomy hand just perfectly.And, even more important, it works a whole lot better. I don'tknow what the \"micro-knit\" tip is made from, possibly somemagical new element like Unobtanium, but it just swoops across thetablet's surface like Miki Ando across the skating rink of the 2011Olympics. It's terrific at drag and drop, smooth and supple. It'saccurate at tapping those tiny little icons, even when there's abunch of them all scrunched together. I've installed the SwiftKeysoftware keyboard on the Nook - the one like Swype that spells outthe words as you dash across the letters with your stylus - andthe New Trent has at least doubled my speed and output.Did I mention that I like pens? This thing's got a pen builtright into it. Turn the shaft clockwise, and a little ballpoint tippops from the rear of the stylus. I don't use my pens much thesedays, but I can't tell you how many times I've been working on thecomputer when I suddenly wanted to write something down, and I had togo fumbling through the mess on my desk to find a pen to do it with.I don't have to fumble anymore. This is a definite life styleimprovement.All in all, I think that the New Trent Stylus is terrific. I'verecommended it to my friends, and if the thing ever broke, which Idon't expect to happen, I'd just go out and buy a new one. It's awell-made, good-looking tool that does exactly what it's supposed to do,and does that extremely well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A great little stylus", "unixReviewTime": 1379894400, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2013"}

The case feels real nice in the hand super low profile so it's not to bulky. The clip and the case look great together also low profile. The clip seems maybe a little flimsy so we'll have to see how that ends up working out. The stylus works exactly how it should, the only thing I don't necessarily like about it is the pocket clip on it is plastic, I think a little metal one would work better. Now this did suck a little, the screen protector doesn't fit the Galaxy S3, it literally just covers the screen not the border around the screen just the actual 4. something inch screen. I'm disappointed in that but I can get another screen protector that fits and still be WAY under retail price on this deal. Over all good buy. I would recommend this product to anyone with a GS3 just make sure you get another screen protector.I would also like to point out that I made my order on Thursday November 29, 2012 and received my package on Saturday December 1, 2012. That was with the FREE SHIPPING offered from the company. Kudos on a super fast delivery. This is the main reason this didn't get 4 stars. I am upset the screen protector fit but it's still a really good deal without it, so 5 stars!

I didn't expect much from something so small, but I was pleasantly surprised by the image and the ease of use.The phone slides into the sleeve snugly, which means it must be removed from its case first. The controls are simple and easy to figure out. I would have liked to see a set of small speakers, but the channel built into the bottom of the case directs the sound from the iPhone's internal speakers and they're audible, but a bit tinny sounding.In a darkened room, the projector's image looks fine up to a distance of 10 feet or so. Beyond that, it begins washing out a bit which isn't surprising given how small this unit is. The Projector Sleeve gets fairly warm while operating for more than a few minutes, but didn't seem affected by the heat at all.I used the Sleeve with several video apps and had good success with all. I was a bit disappointed that it couldn't project the iPhone screen, but that's a very minor nit. My kids loved dragging the Projector Sleeve around the house and watching movies.Please note: The 3M Projector Sleeve is for iPhone 4/4S ONLY. After evaluating it with an iPhone 4 and 4S, I tried it with my iPhone 5 and the 30 pin to lightening adapter with no success at all. The iPhone 5 adapter doesn't seem to provide any sort of video out at least with the current cable.

Turns out this device does not work very well for me.- Turning it on and off requires holding a hidden button on the back of the unit for several seconds.  This is not so bad the first time you do it, but becomes increasingly annoying over time.  I don't understand why the unit was designed to require such a long hold on the on/off button, and why the button does not have any tactile feel.  It has a slight depression where you're supposed to push, but I often miss it, requiring even more time to turn it on/off.- I find the FM modulator unusable.  I live in a congested area - there are only a couple FM frequencies that are open during my entire commute.  The unit automatically searches for open freqs - you can't set them.  All you can do is push the search button so the unit looks for another open freq.  I never could get it to find the truly open freqs, so would have to change freq several times during my half hour commute.  After a few days I gave up.- Due to the problems with the FM modulator I ended up using the built in speaker exclusively.  That actually works pretty well for audio books.  It is only slightly louder than my cell phone, but is easier to hear since it is on the visor near my ear.  Unfortunately, with some books recorded at lower levels, I sometimes have trouble hearing over the road noise, so this mode is only slightly better than just listening to the phone directly.- The phone function works OK.  Some people have complained about the sound quality they are hearing, but most think it is OK.- Since it is battery powered, every few days I need to recharge it which is a hassle compared to my previous fm modulator which just stayed plugged into the cigarette lighter.Today I accidentally dropped it with the charger plugged in and the charging connector broke, so my 9 months with this unit are happily over.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Disappointed", "unixReviewTime": 1273017600, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2010"}

Those pretty colors and cheap prices are going to give you heartburn.

Next, and more importantly, is that pogo uses a little black rubber o-ring between the foam and the aluminum stick so that when you apply pressure and as the foam wears, you do not hit the screen with the metal shaft. The others do not have this feature and when you wear out the foam, you smack your glass screen with a sharp aluminum stick.

The interchangeable USB plug has a 30-pin iPod plug, a MicroUSB A plug, a Samsung cell phone plug, and a Nokia plug.

It was able to charge both quickly and it has enough battery life to handle multiple charges without any problems.  For laptops, it couldn't charge my HP Envy laptop on it as the smallest HP plug that it came with was too short for the power plug.  I would recommend this with some caveats.

I use a Bluetooth during the day so not feeling confident that my Bose would be able to have enough power to take the next call was problematic.

The part that fits to my belt is really good, the outer case that fits the phone is ok but there is very poor retention of the phone in the holster.  The innovative retention mechanism is the lip of the holster is suppose to keep the phone from sliding out.  However, if you use this in a horizontal position, I feel quite comfortable that you will loose your phone.  It slides out with hardly any resistance. For me, having the phone vertical is not comfortable due to the length of the phone but fortunately it does rotate at degreed increments and seems to hold that position fairly well.  Even with the holster canted at a 45 angle, the phone has the potential to come out of the holster if I run or jump...not a good thing. I don't feel the item is defective in any way but just lacking in some design details. The materials and overall appearance of the item are quite acceptable but it's unfortunate that they didn't make provisions for a retention strap or something better to secure the phone.I will try to make some modifications and live with it until something better comes along but just wanted potential buyers to be aware of the loose fit and potential loss of your phone.REVISION: 5-12-10I have found that I can improve the retention qualities of this holster by applying some tape to the inside of the two opposing guide lugs.

Yes the battery indicator does not indicate a green light for rechargeable batteries, so you do need a voltmeter, and I have seen voltmeters at the dollar store that work well or on this site for a buck or two. Of course your batteries will charge without a voltmeter, it's just so you will know when the batteries are fully charged. Just use common sense depending on the weather. This charger so far, works great, as long as you have patients and a little understanding for the still in process movement of solar energy. This charger charges four AA within a charge, or two AAA batteries within one charge, one charge can take up to 1 to 2 or 4 days, this all depends on your location, weather, and rechargeable batteries you are using. This device fully charged my HTC Touch just fine off of two AA batteries; you can charge a device with either 4 AA batteries in the charger which is nice! Or you can charge a device with 2 AA batteries in the charger which works fine as well; you can also charge a device with regular none chargeable batteries (single use batteries)! That is a big plus for those who travel a lot. Those who want the option of being able to charge their digital cameras, phones, or whatever device it may be that can handle the correct charge from this charger. The USB output is DC 5.0---350mA and the charging current is 200mA for 2 batteries and 100mA for 4 batteries. My unit did come in a package that was sealed, and yes it has a shiny finish, but there are some small scratches that make it look like it was used before hand (which I doubt, I think it's just the best finish they can come up with).  So far the unit is working good, I recommend it for either travel, or emergencies, because you can use regular none rechargeable batteries to charge up your devices successfully, make sure you test it out before leaving town, and yes you can use rechargeable batteries, just recognize the time it may take to charge it. The other reason why I recommend this device is for emergencies, or even if SHTF for those who know what I am talking about :) it will work great for flash lights and portable games for your kids. Oh I almost forgot, the other poster was right, the durability is not solid, but not that weak either (meaning it won't break as long as you don't throw it against a wall or drop it 50 times like some do with their phones. I will repost on here with updates, I plan on testing out outdoor solar light rechargeable batteries in this charger, and please excuse my grammar; I am posting this as a favor to you, and hope it helped a little.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "XTG  Solar AA & AAA Battery Charger With Multiple Options", "unixReviewTime": 1301702400, "reviewTime": "04 2, 2011"}

Like many looking for extra battery charging solutions I looked at Amazon and saw the Anker 2 batteries and charger for $22.99 vs Samsung charger and 1 battery for $34.99. I really thought long and hard when i would need an extra battery and the rotation of 3 batteries if I bought the Anker product. First of all  from a battery analysis review Anker makes a good battery, but like all third party wall chargers the length of time is like 8-10hrs making it basically an overnight charger. The point of having an extra battery is either someone doesn't want to have to wait while their phone charges or they won't have access to charge phone at any given point and want convienence.People into technolgy want things to be fast and trouble free. If I had three batteries and it took me 8-10 hours to charge each one i think i would go nuts. For some putting a battery in before you go to bed is ok but there are times when you would be trying to get all three batteries charged for a trip or just getting to the hotel from a flight after all three batteries would need to be recharged, and for those times it would be hard to get the cycle of three batteries being charged at the same time again to troublesome.I would get so tired of waiting that I would probably just discard the Anker wall charger and just charged all three batteries from the phone itself ,  having to take off the cover of the phone to many times for me. So to save from the fustration I coughed up the extra money and got the Samsung charger and 1 extra battery opposed to 2 batteries from 3rd party. Granted i will have to pair it with my current charging cable for the quickest time but I think it is the best solution. I don't care if you had 5 batteries, if you have a crapy charger what's the point. Yes you could leave a couple here and there but that would get confusing.G2 battery is a beast anyways and an extra battery would be great, but 3 batteries with a 8-10hrs charge time each is mising the point. &#34; I ain't got time for that!!!&#34;", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I Ain't Got Time for That!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1365379200, "reviewTime": "04 8, 2013"}

I cleaned it with regular soap and water and the stickiness came back to about 98% which isn't bad. The arms actually have grooves on the top and bottom so it will hold on to the edges of your phone nicely and securely.

Now it doesn't work on your dashboard if its got any grooves in it. I have yet to find one that has that type of suction. If I ever find it I will be very happy. If you're looking for something that will last over time then this is it. It will stay on your windshield at any temperature except 100 degrees but really when is it really that hot? Get the darn thing and attach it to your windshield and you'll be happy. I bet you you'll love it. It can even hold a soda can filled with soda and still not fall off.

Schumacher", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "I hate to be one of the only people to not give this item a 5 star rating, but I can't after having the same problem twice! First off let me start by saying this is an excellent quality screen protector and MIME has excellent customer service! I purchased the ghost glass for my galaxy s4 from their website. I received it and read the instructions carefully. I then put latex gloves on both hands so that fingerprints wouldn't get on the glass. I first wiped my screen with the included cloth, and then used the purple sticky film provided to remove any remaining particles. As soon as I lifted that off my screen I peeled of the protector from my glass and I lined it up with my screen, but as soon as I let go of the glass so it could adhere by itself, the whole protector shifted. It was way off center which caused me to have to pick it up off my screen and try again. Unfortunately I had to remove and reapply it about 7 or 8 times, literally. It kept shifting on my screen every time I let go! Finally the last time it was centered, so I let it do it's thing and adhere to my screen. Afterwards I gently pressed down with my fingers. Then I noticed that there were many particles trapped underneath the ghost glass. I wasn't happy about that and it must be because I had to remove and reapply so many times. Second thing is that afterwards the top left corner of the glass didn't adhere like the rest of it and I can't explain it but you could tell there was something on my screen and it looked like that part of the glass had some kind of defect. It was very noticeable and driving me crazy. I contacted MIME and sent them a few pictures. They gave me a code for a free replacement protector! So my replacement ghost glass comes and I decide I'm going to install it in the biggest, most open room of the house because I thought that would be where there is the least amount of dust. I took off the protector that was on. I wiped my screen with included cloth, then I put the purple sticky sheet on my entire front of my phone and I pressed down on it with my fingers. I kept it on for about two minutes. I took my phone to the table where I had my ghost glass. As soon as I removed the purple sheet I inspected my screen and there was not a speck of dust. I immediately removed the plastic protector from my glass (had latex gloves on during entire process) and I was very careful to make sure it was centered with the speaker and home button and it was, so I let go and let it adhere. Then I noticed that once it adhered all the way it wasn't centered with my home button. There is much more space on the left side of it then the right. I figured the glass must have shifted again when I let go, but I didn't want to remove it once it was on there. So I gently pressed on it with my fingers. There is also two particles that got trapped under the glass, not sure how because there wasn't a speck of anything on my screen. When I removed the plastic from my glass, it was very close to my phone, so I don't know how there could have been enough time for anything to stick to it. So overall I'm very happy with the product itself, but the installation is definitely NOT a piece of cake like everyone is claiming including MIME. I've become a pro  at  screen protectors on phones, and other devices and I've never had a problem with them being off centered like this! It's hard for me to believe that everyone else said there's not one speck of dust or particles under their glass. I installed two screen protectors and both times had stuff trapped under the glass! If anyone thinks I'm not being truthful about how mine turned out, I would be more then happy to take pics of the front of my phone, showing the glass is not centered with the home button and hopefully it would show the particles underneath.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excellent quality item, installation problems both times!", "unixReviewTime": 1377216000, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2013"}
{"reviewerID": "A3LLMT0DX24Z9K", "asin": "B00C96CDBM", "reviewerName": "Gadget Master", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "I always take care of my smart phones.  They usually look new when I am done with them.  My last phone was a Motorola Droid, which I housed in a TPU case.  It looked nice and protected well for scratches. However, when taking one of my walks I tripped. The phone did not fall far - but it was far enough.  Devastation!My new phone is a Samsung S4.  I love the phone - but it does not seem as sturdy as my old Droid. And that Droid shattered. So I need to protect my S4.  I purchased two top rated cases to see what is best for my needs: the OtterBox Defender and the Trident AMS Kraken.Summary:Both the Kraken and the OtterBox Defender were real close for my needs.  The one that I ended up using is the Trident AMS Kraken.My final choice was because I felt the Kraken to be somewhat better than the OtterBox.  I got quite frustrated by the proximity sensor not working correctly with the OtterBox.  This prevented me from accessing the phone after the screen turned off during calls.  I also felt that the body of the Kraken would protect the phone better.If interested in my reviews, I have another write up for the Trident AMS Kraken case.Detailed review of the OtterBox Defender case:Appearance:  I chose the blue color.  Very nice shade.  The case consists of a colored polycarbonate shell covered with a slab of black silicon. Of course the case made my thin phone look huge - but that is the price that one pays for protection.  I feel that the OtterBox Defender looks plain.Physical characteristics:The inner polycarbonate shell acts like a skeleton, adding strength to the phone.  The outer silicon liner cushions the phone and absorbs most of the shock.The inner shell goes together easily and has a good fit.  Taking it apart to clean the phone was at first hard.  After a few times it was not so bad.The silicon is stiffer than that used in many products because it is so thick.  It extends over each corner of the phone.  The silicon is easy to install. If you place the phone face down the surface is protected by the silicon.  This seems to be a very high quality silicon and will protect the phone against most small accidents.The silicon provides two additional features: the volume and the power switch are covered, and there are plugs for the headphone jack and the USB connector.  The volume and power switch are well protected, but they are also hard to use. The silicon is just too thick and stiff.  At least the odds are that the power switch being accidently pressed while in one's pocket is slim. Of course a substitute when the screen is off is to press the home button. But you really should be able to easily use the power switch as needed.  The headphone jack cover works great.  The USB connector cover fits well - but it is sometimes difficult to guide a USB connector into place.  This sometimes is frustrating connecting power to the phone.There are no cutouts or other consideration for ventilation.  Most of the time the Samsung S4 runs cool.  But at times it did get very warm.The polycarbonate front bevel extends enough to protect the screen, but not too much to obstruct any of the active portion of the screen.  Unlike other cases, the notification bar can readily be accessed without any extra effort.  No fear of hitting wrong buttons because there is not room for your fingers.The soft silicon outer shell makes it simple when you put the phone down on a surface.  It will not slip.  It will not damage the surface. Yet it is sufficiently smooth to easily slip in or out of your pocket.The silicon does not pick up pet hair.Other factors:Sound quality - phone calls:  The phone speaker worked quite well.  When talking on the phone you can easily hear the other party.  Now for the bad news. The microphone does not work well in this case.  The other party can hear you, along with echoes and muffled sound.  I got continuous complaints from people that could not hear me properly when on calls.Sound quality - phone speaker for music: no degradation of sound quality.  Not that the S4 speaker is that great in the first place .. but the case does not make it any worse.Sensor access: The S4 proximity sensor does not work with this case.  Once activated, the sensor gets stuck (confirm with the CPU-Z and AndroSendor tools).  Why is this important?  One use of the proximity sensor is to determine when to turn off the screen.  If you get a phone call and you put the phone to your ear, the proximity sensor will turn off the screen. Access to the touch screen is prevented so that you cannot accidentally press buttons. The problem is that the sensor does not detect when the phone is moved away from the ear.  When you move the screen away from your ear, the screen should become visible and you should be able to use the touch screen. With the proximity sensor not working, the screen does not free up until the other party hangs up from your call.  If the other person does not hang up you cannot use your screen again! During the call you cannot look up contacts, or do any of the other multi-tasking that your phone is designed for.  On some S4 forums, I read that black cases do not seem to have as much of this problem.  I also read that some people claim use of a black magic marker around the opening where the sensor is located helps.  I tried using a black magic marker and the sensor worked better - but still not consistently.  Carefully applied you can hardly see the black.Screen protector: the top portion of the polycarbonate shell has an integrated screen protector.  This is the thickest screen protector that I have used.  It seems quite rugged. It resists fingerprints and cleans up quite easily.  The phone's touch screen worked surprisingly well behind this plastic.  However, it felt different - the screen was close, but not as responsive as with other cases with more pliable films. I did feel comfortable that the screen was well protected.Support: I called OtterBox support because of problems with the proximity sensor.  First contact had a new inner shell that was shipped immediately.  There was no attempt to support beyond that.  When I continued to complain, they readily permitted me to return the case for a refund. So good news is that they took responsibility to provide a refund. Bad news is that they did not actually try to solve my problem.  If this was a unique problem I could understand.  However, looking at other forums I see that the sensor problem is fairly widespread. I would think that it would be more responsible of OtterBox if they would solve the problem.  That said, my son-in-law has an S4 with an OtterBox defender (grey case).  Works perfectly for him.Belt clip:  Sturdy and works.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great case limited by proximity sensor problem and telephone microphone sound", "unixReviewTime": 1379894400, "reviewTime": "09 23, 2013"}

Sounds too good to be true!'Well, it is. Do a bit of research first. If not, look for one of these on sale for $15, which happens from time to time. At that cost it's not a bad buy even if it just ends up being a fancy little paperweight. The two big caveats with FreedomPop's Photon are:1. The device uses Sprint's 4G wimax technology.2. The device has no 3G fallback.First, a brief history. Sprint's WiMax network used to be a company called Clearwire, which they owned a large amount of stock in and eventually bought outright for some unfathomable reason. To make a long story short the rollout of their WiMax network was aborted- for 'financial reasons' Sprint decided to halt it and instead go with LTE. As such, the WiMax network is incomplete and has an uncertain future.What this means for you (as a FreedomPop owner) is:1. Coverage in general is terrible. I live in Silicon Valley and even here it is very poor. If you live in the middle of nowhere, just forget it. The coverage maps, by the way, are a pretty poor reflection of reality (those assume the towers are all up, broadcasting at full power, not throttled, and are being maintained- all very big assumptions).2. Even if you have coverage, don't expect LTE or anything approaching broadband speed. The hardware and software for this network was never fully matured and will never be. I suspect it's also throttled in some areas- sure seems so to me.3. In all likelihood, this service's days are numbered. And that number is not very big.A more detailed explanation: since the rollout was never finished, there are a lot of dead spots- in fact pretty much the whole Midwest is one, and even heavily populated cities like San Francisco have really spotty coverage. This also means if you're using it on the go, FreedomPop will drop on and off and the battery will die in no time from constant attempts to reacquire signal.If there was 3G fallback on this device and it was still 500 MB a month for free, it would be a great deal as that would solve the coverage problem. Ditto for 4G LTE at no monthly fee. However, neither of these will EVER happen. Why? Well, as long as it's only using the Sprint WiMax network, it's not eating up anyone else's bandwidth. Sprint stopped selling devices using that network 2 years ago, and in all likelihood most of those are no longer being used- making Clearwire perhaps the most under-utilized 'national' network in human history. WiMax uses a different frequency from both 3G and 4G LTE, so Sprint is losing nothing farming out this network at little to no charge. However, if FreedomPop plugged into 3G or LTE, that's a different story- now you're eating up bandwidth that is also being used by Sprint customers- many of whom are paying $70 or more a month for service. Yeah, that's just not going to go for free and is why FreedomPop's hotspots with 3G fallback charge a monthly fee for any service.What irks me most about this device and which I find unforgivable is the marketing comparing it to hotspots offered by Verizon and AT&T; showing you saving some $1200 annually. Well yeah, you'll save around that much- but they're comparing this device running on WiMax with no fallback to hotspots running on 4G LTE with 3G fallback. They're also neglecting to mention the little fact that it will be EOL'd in a year or two. At any rate it's totally misleading- pay no heed to it.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Shady marketing", "unixReviewTime": 1402790400, "reviewTime": "06 15, 2014"}

Chambers", "helpful": [14, 15], "reviewText": "The 5-6-hour battery life typical of many cellphones is barely enough for heavy telephone usage, much less the texting, emails, location services, and apps that drain batteries. Since it's not always possible to be near an AC charger or car charger, an external battery pack is a necessity for many people nowadays. (The recent storms that knocked out electrical power to millions of people is further proof of the need for external battery packs.) In my opinion, there are four key issues to take into account when buying an external battery pack:1. Form factor. I'm including both size and weight. You'll most likely be carrying the charger in your pocket, purse, travel bag, or glove compartment of your vehicle. Smaller and lighter are better.2. Capacity. Rechargers come in a range of capacities from about 2,500 mAh to as high as 12,000 mAh. Figure that 2,300-2,700 mAh is about the equivalent power of a typical rechargeable AA NiMH battery, and that may give you some idea of a battery pack's capacity. Mobile devices will vary a lot in how much capacity it takes to recharge their internal batteries, with the larger tablets requiring considerably more power than a smaller cellphone.3. Reliability. As with any other product, go with brand names you're familiar with, or ones with reviews that you trust.4. Value. Battery packs with higher capacities will generally cost more than ones with smaller capacities. Figure on some tradeoff between size/weight, capacity, and price that fits your budget and gives the capacity you need.---------------------------------------Yubi Power sent me one of their YP520A 5200mAh External Battery Pack units to review. The device appears to be well made, and it was very compact (3.9\" x 1.6\" x 0.8\"). Adapter plugs are included for Apple devices and other devices that have Micro-USB and Mini-USB ports, which include the majority of mobile devices sold today. The output is 5 volts @ 2.1 amps. There's also a flashlight built into the charger.The battery pack can be recharged with an AC wall charger or car charger that provides greater than 500mA. I gave it a full charge in about five hours using a Kindle AC charger (5 volts @ 0.85 amps). Alternatively, the unit can be recharged from the USB port of a PC. Although the battery pack does not include a charger, most users will already have AC wall chargers or car chargers that will work.I tested the Yubi Power battery pack on my Samsung smartphone and my Kindle Fire HD tablet. I was most interested to see how long it required to increase their charge from about 90% to a full 100% charge. With the Kindle Fire HD, it required about 45 minutes; with the smartphone a bit less than a half hour. I also tried recharging my e-Ink Kindle reader, and it recharged it, too.Overall, I'm impressed with the Yubi Power external battery pack. It appears to be well made, it's compact, and it works very well with all of our mobile devices. Considering the size and weight, the 5200 mAh capacity, and the price, it's a very good value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A very compact but effective battery pack", "unixReviewTime": 1352851200, "reviewTime": "11 14, 2012"}

Let me start with whats good.  It looks great, and feels solid in the hand.Now onto the bad.  Motorola decided to yuck this up with their terrible Moto Blur skin.  What that means is that user interface looks ugly, and it does a bad job of adding to the stock android experience.  Next lets move onto Verizon's slow as molasses 3g speeds. In a nutshell, verizon has the slowest 3g data speeds of all major carriers in the US.  What this means is that AT&T; and T-mobile 3G phones can download and stream videos  nearly 4 to 5 times faster.  I know because I also have a t-mobile account and that 3g phone always beats this one in bandwidth tests. 1.5Mb's on Verizon vs 5.5Mb on T-Mobile.  Needless to say it's a huge difference.Also gaming stinks on this phone.  The TiOmap cpu/gpu that motorola used in this phone is very cheap compared to the CPU/GPU that Samsung uses in their Galaxy S phones.  At best, performace wise this phone barely has as much horse power as HTC's Nexus one which was released well over a year ago.So there you go.  Save your money and buy either a newer HTC phone like the thunderbolt (at least it has an LTE radio), or save up for the new Samsung Galaxy S II phones that samsung just announced.  Engadget said it was the best smartphone they have EVER tested.  Eat that iphone.  Currently Motorola's android phones all stink compared to Samsung, and HTC's best.Compared to the iPhone:  There's no comparison, the iPhone blows this hunk of junk away.  Anyone who says otherwise is simply in denial, and has never used an iphone.  The Droid X is for people who want a free smartphone, simply to get their feet wet.  This is in no way a powerhouse of a phone, and it's very buggy.  I'm a huge android, and have supported it from day one with my old T-mobile g1.

However, I cannot fault Belkin for that because they clearly indicate that no label is included if you read through the product page and the packaging also includes a sticker instructing you to use your own lightning cable.However, I don't know what value this product serves, especially at close to $30. Here are the functions I see it can perform if I had to really think about it:+ Keeps your iPhone upright.+ Manages the cables on your desk somewhat.So, you're paying $30 to keep your phone upright and organize your cables, but then even there it fails.- You have to use your own lightning cable, so if you need to take it with you then you need to go through the process of unhooking it from the cradle. In my opinion, that's more work than benefit.- Let's say you just want to charge your phone and forget that you have it on ring. If you don't have your headphones plugged in or are not listening to them then it's very likely someone can call you and you'll miss the call as you won't hear the phone ringing.Overall, I think this product is an absolute waste of money and not even sure how Belkin let this release to market.********* I received this product for free as part of the Amazon.com Vine program.

So here goes:PROS:1. I think it fits comfortably on the ear and looks great when worn.2. It turns off when placed in the charger and turns on when removed.  Very thoughtful feature.3. More inconspicuous than other headsets.4. The lights are on the inside, and they turn on only when needed.  Again, very thoughtful.CONS:1. Too expensive.  This is perhaps the most expensive headset I've seen.  It's worth more in the $70 to $80 range, and that'spushing it.2. You can't just tap the headset to answer/end a call.  Jabra's manual states that these functions are done with a tap, butit also does describe it as a brief \"press\", which is what's needed.  This press tends to force the earpiece more into theear, which can be uncomfortable. So keep in mind, it's NOT a TAP.3. I had a lot of problems with increasing the volume. Lowering it was much more responsive and I used the same force and slidmy finger along the same area, and MY MAIN COMPLAINT:4. The speaker is aimed toward the side of the ear canal (in other words to the front of the device), and not to the insideof the canal.  This baffled me because a lot of the sound is actually muffled by part of the outer ear itself.  I wouldthink that Jabra would want to direct the sound INTO the canal.  This is like placing boombox speakers two inches from awall with the sound directed toward the wall.  Speakers should be place TOWARD their intended targets. Anyway, I pushedthe speaker little more to the inside of the canal and, lo and behold, the audio was excellent.  Unfortunately, the headsetpulls itself back out (normal fit), so the sound will be muffled.I actually WANTED to like this headset.  I would have kept it except it really makes me wonder why Jabra aimed the speakerlike that.

At $23, price seemed reasonable.  I really like the convenience of my Exhibit 2 but can't make it through the day without plugging in.  I use my phone as mp3 player and also light web browsing among other things.  Also I noticed my phone goes from 4G to EDGE and back to 4G depending on my location in the building, which can't be good for the battery.I've been using the Anker instead of plugging in for the last week and figured I can get a full charge and maybe half more, which is more than enough for a typical day.  I loaned it to a co-worker to charge her phone for 45 minutes and the battery went from 20 to 45% with light use.  I did notice that my co-worker could easily place the Anker behind her phone and still use it while I put alot of tension on the embedded usb.  Her phone has USB on side while my USB is on top of phone.  I would have liked the cord to be a little longer, but it works.  (Time will tell how durable the cord is.)  Even though I see no need for the USB port at this time, it does work and is a nice extra.  I have only seen a few phones that don't use micro-usb, and most of these are I-Phones.I do like the finish, but it's a fingerpring magnet.  The flashlight is more useful than I expected; not as white as the LED flash of my Exhibit 2, but lights about the same area.  (Never have too many flashlights.)Suggestions to the manufacturer:a) make the embedded micro-usb cord at least half inch longer so I don't have to worry about breaking the cord when back-to-back against my phone.b) make a larger capacity battery version (5000 to 6000 mAh should do it).Then your product would be almost perfect!UPDATE 12/07/12 Still works like a charm.  I usually charge the battery every day when I get home from work.  Have not used away from work yet, but plan to.  Showed several co-workers and they plan to buy one based on my good results.  The battery usually has between 25 and 50% charge and my phone still has about 80% charge.  The micro usb has not been yanked out of the battery yet.

The \"Jabra Sound\" app is listed as free in the Apple app store, but won't unlock unless you supply a code bundled with these headphones. I thought at first this was just a gimmick, but the sound does significantly improve with the Dolby Digital+ processing enabled by the Jabra app. The headphones are fine with normal sound sources, it's just that they do sound significantly better with the Jabra app.The Jabra app is fairly full-featured.  It imports all your normal iTunes playlists, does Shuffle and Repeat, and has a built-in 7 band equalizer, which is a step up from the Apple music app which hides equalizer functionality in the Settings app and only offers presets, rather than bands you can set yourself. Not that I'll likely ever use this ability myself, but I'm sure some people will find this a nice feature. The main thing the Jabra app won't do is let you set track ratings (1-5 stars).These headphones are significantly louder than my Bose headphones at the same volume, or an ordinary pair of earbuds for that matter. They don't offer as much noise isolation as the Quiet Comforts since they're on-ear rather than over the ear, and once the Quiet Comforts are on the difference is even more dramatic since those feature noise cancellation. Still, in ordinary environments (i.e. not on board a plane or using a snow blower) I prefer these.These are well constructed. I particularly like the nylon covering on the headphone cord, and the way the cord connects to the headphones via a 3.5mm plug rather than a direct connection. There are jacks on both the right and left earphones, so you can switch the cord to whichever is more convenient, and if you snag the cord on something it will detach from the headphones instead of yanking hard on them and possibly breaking.The controls are 6\" down the cord from the earphone, probably because the small cylinder with the controls also houses the microphone, which needs to be close to your head. I'm using these with an iPod rather than an iPhone, so I didn't test the sound quality for phone calls.  A quick test with the Voice Memo app showed the sound quality seemed decent enough.The three buttons on the controls are volume up, volume down, and a center \"multi purpose\" button which handles receiving phone calls, pause / play, and track skipping. One tap is play / pause, two rapid taps is track forward, three is track backward. I found all of these worked perfectly with my iPod 4th generation, though two-three taps is a bit awkward.Overall, I'm quite pleased with these.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sturdy, great sound", "unixReviewTime": 1364169600, "reviewTime": "03 25, 2013"}

I've purchased more of these items than any other electric gadget over the years, and their quality surpasses all the others. Here's why:1. Durability of the product. These chargers are made well, solidly assembled, and FEEL this way. The sleek design seems to fit perfectly into the hand for putting into the car charging port. Other chargers I've used are too short, don't fit well and/or feel flimsy. I've had tons of these fall apart.2. Flexibility of the product. While I've purchased many car chargers that have the cord attached, all of these wore out quickly. The combo of using your standard OE USB cable with the NT Rapiduo allows flexibility for both multiple devices but also allows for the OE USB cord to come out, thus avoiding overwear on a a cheaper third party cord. No doubt NT could produce an equal-quality USB cord but most name brand USB Cords don't hold up like the OE's, particularly Apple's.3. Functionality. You can't beat the &#34;Dual&#34; function: charging two devices out of one plug is great! But buying a two pack allows four devices in one standard car. My first experience using this was to charge my wife's iPad and my iPhone 5, something we've never been able to do in her car due to only one lighter port.4. Power. The greatest &#34;plus&#34; for the Rapiduo- it charged my wife's iPad 3 as fast (I actually think it was faster) than the wall port. It did this WHILE charging my iPhone 5. In about 20 minutes of driving, it charged each device more than 20%. After trying many charging options and getting fed up with low quality and /or slow charging, the Rapiduo is a sure bet for any average to heavy electronics user like me.I travel daily with a list of about 40 places to frequent, and look forward to using these devices regularly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Auto-matic Buy!", "unixReviewTime": 1388448000, "reviewTime": "12 31, 2013"}

A few things have changed, and for the better.The fitThe case is easy to attach, and improves on the previous model by also making it easy to remove.  The top of the case slides out and stops a quarter of an inch above where the top of the iPhone will rest.  Once the phone is in, the top clicks back into place.  I was worried that the phone would fall out, but days later it hasn't budged from where it should be.  I wondered if the brace would hold if the phone is dropped, but haven't had the nerve to test it.  This isn't specifically a phone protector case so I can only speculate. I will say, though, that the case does come with a screen cover to protect from minor bumps and scrapes.  I have removed my phone from the case and replaced it several times a day over the course of a week, and it has worked flawlessly, without any worrying cracking noises.LooksThe case looks great from the back, and does its best to stay out of the way in the front.  The sides are entirely open, giving easy access to the volume buttons, and the speaker, mic and camera are all unobstructed.  The lightning port is blocked, since that is where the battery booster plugs in.  The case is very thin and light, adding less weight to the phone than I had expected, and keeping the thickness very pocketable.BatterySo far, out of four battery state lights, I have never burned down more than 1 in a day, even working in a building with bad cell reception and cell data on, wifi, and playing games.  I'm not a power phone user, but I play a lot of games.  When my phone gets down to 68% or less, I switch on the battery and I'm back to 100% in a few minutes.Cons?I haven't discovered any serious drawbacks to the case, as of yet, only minor issues.  While charging at night, the indicator lights are bright enough to be a night light, which may be an issue if you require absolute darkness.  The openness of the case tends to mean that pocket lint collects in the crevices of the phone and case, though it's easy enough to clean.ConclusionOverall, I can't recommend this case enough.  It's reasonably priced (or was at the time I bought it), works very well as a backup battery, and stays out of your way while in use.  A real bonus is that the company, Alpatronix, is very responsive to customers, and makes dealing with them easy.

Amith (kndy)", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "The LG ENV touch was my first entry to touch-based screens (I'm still waiting for the iPhone for Verizon - let's hope for early 2011) and I have had it for a year because if I have given a review when I first got it, I would probably have written and raved about it.  But here is my feelings about the phone afterward.After I purchased the LG ENV Touch, it seemed in July 2009, it seemed that right after, there were a good number of better phones that came out right after.  Droid-based phones, new touch devices and granted, this is common and the fact that this phone did not need a data plan which was convenient.But if you are planning to get the LG ENV Touch, there are three things I do recommend. And if anything, you can learn from my mistakes as I tend to drop my cell phones and well, not take the best care of them, like I should.1.  Buy a screen protector - Had this in my suit jacket along with my keys and sure enough, big nice scratch on the screen (sigh).2.  Buy a case protector.  No, not the thin ones for aesthetics.  I'm talking like those Body Glove protectors that are thick because I've dropped this phone many times.  You could try your best and not try to drop it but things happen and in my case, it has created this warping around edge of the top right (obviously some screen damage).3.  Buy a micro SD card.  No you don't have to buy an expensive version, don't be fooled by \"cell phone only\" as Micro SD card is the same no matter what. With that being said, I've read people not having any success but using Sandisk cards which I do use and I purchased it cheap like $2.99.  Do not spend over $15 for one.  Shop around.POSITIVES:- Great for texting and also for those who use it as an MP3 device to listen to music or podcasts.  Great for those who need to store a database as you can read your excel spreadsheets, documents and PDF's.- Great keyboard, easy to use.- Not that hard to use bitpim on but much easier to load your ringtones on your Micro SD card.- Ease of use.  First time, it might take an hour but after that, you'll get the hang of it.- Connection to your computer via USB to transfer files (to the Micro SD card) is easy.- Quick charge via USB.- Love the speaker phone.- Easy to use apps.- Views .wmv videos quite fine.NEGATIVES:- Battery life - Like most cell phones, you may need an extended battery depending on your use.- This is where I recommend the case because I've dropped this and now the sensitive touch screen will not work that well, I have to flip it on to get it to work. To make things worse, I need to keep the lock on because it starts acting like it's possessed and starts acting on its own as if someone is trying to do several inputs.  Weird.- Photos are not as clear as my wife's Samsung touch phone- Views .wmv videos but very few formats and they have to be several minutes not long.  Tried to put a movie and video wouldn't work, just audio.Overall, The ENV Touch is a very good phone for the basic use having a cell phone and of course, bells and whistles to accompany it. It's not a smart phone, so no data service is required.Since mine is the first generation, one can wonder what LG will have next for the next generation of it.  But learn my situation and get the screen protector and a thicker holder/protector and also a Micro SD card (since they are cheap these days).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "I have had this phone for nearly a year and...", "unixReviewTime": 1282176000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2010"}

Brand name cables are in the realm of $30 to $40.00, so the price and overall rating of this cable was attractive.This cable will transmit a video signal to any HD TV or monitor with an HDMI input via the phone's micro USB port. It is essential to plug the male USB connector on the cable to a charging source rated at least 5v/1A. Most, if not all TVs and monitors with USB ports will not be able to source enough power to charge the phone for allowing use of the HDMI connection, so a standard USB wall charger will suffice as long as it provides enough power.It was packaged appropriately, neatly coiled up in a plastic bag within a padded envelope. The cable itself seems to be of around average quality, and is on the flexible [more &#34;rubbery&#34; than &#34;plasticky&#34;] side... which may or may not be a good thing. The actual micro USB, Male USB and HDMI connectors feel a little cheap, but it isn't especially glaring.I unplugged my Blu-Ray player which functions on the HDMI port I used to test this cable. This cable's HDMI connection felt a little less than confident. I did at first attempt to plug the USB power connection into my Samsung HDTV's nearby USB port [right next to the HDMI input], but it did not source enough power to charge the phone while it was connected and therefore the TV did not recognize my Note II.The USB power cord of the cable isn't very long, which lead me to believe it was designed to plug into the monitor's USB port as a power source, but does in fact need the juice from a wall charger. I eagerly dug up a surge protector and rigged an extension with a quality USB wall charger. The phone was not recognized via HDMI even after several reboots of both it and the Samsung TV [in different orders, as suggested by some users] and accessing/refreshing the TV's sources.I tried again with a standalone LG monitor. It was at a different location and I packed the cable to bring with me and try it out, thinking my own TV could be the problem. I plugged everything in, again needing to figure out how I was going to plug the USB power cord into a wall outlet, and... nothing. Upon wiggling the connectors and cables a little bit, a picture finally came up and my phone recognized the monitor.I spent a few minutes flipping through applications and generally embellishing the big screen experience, but the display would intermittently turn black, sometimes showing static momentarily between the connections/disconnections.I believe the problem lies in where the cables and connectors are fused. Things are a little thin overall and I wouldn't be surprised if just a few light tugs/pulls from normal use and rolling up for storage could result in a poor connection. HDMI cables in general need to be pretty thick and generally provide a robust connection; USB cables are more prone to damage even from coiling up or tugging associated with typical use.I am unsure if I will be trying another one of these as an alternative to a brand name cable. Even if the next one of these worked perfectly right out of the box, I doubt it would last with regular use and storage. I believe many negative reviews for cables like these are the result of user error [getting the wrong cable for a device, not setting up correctly, overall lack of troubleshooting, etc.] and don't reflect the actual experience with the product. Therefore, I am more inclined to purchase a cable by Samsung or other in hopes it is slightly higher quality.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "You get what you pay for.", "unixReviewTime": 1359244800, "reviewTime": "01 27, 2013"}

It does not drift or droop at all which locked in an unconventional position.I really enjoy the way this thing snaps into place when you place your phone into it (I am using an iPhone 5)- it grips onto the device well enough that it does not slip. Clicking the buttons in on the sides to extend the arms so you can pop your phone into it is a breeze and sometimes I catch myself just doing that and putting my phone into the cradle just to feel and heard the satisfying &#34;click&#34; of the arms closing down on it.Also, the bottom of the phone is exposed so you can charge your phone while it is docked (For iPhones - all-/iPod touch at least)I purchased this because I bought a new car.

In fact, driving with the radio on and my son singing in the background, my wife couldn't hear it at all, so the noise cancellation seems to work great.  It does still bug a little that it's trickier to open one-handed when you get a call while driving.  And this one couldn't handle the washing machine (again) so I'll be ordering another one.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Very pleased with the H17 after a month of daily use.  Had an H715 which was great & sturdy, but couldn's survive the washing machine for some reason.  Overall, i'm pleased with it. Bought it from Amazon for thirteen $ LESS than current price (lower than free ship threshold), but it came in a plastic bag - no pkging.  It was all new, so for that price, i tried it and have been satisfied.PROS:-very small, very light-very loud, have to lower volume more than increase-noise-cancellation - people say sound quality is great, even when i'm driving or outside.-flip-to-answer is great - saves battery life-reasonably comfortable, as long as you find which of the included 3 ear clips fits best-uses standard micro USB charging and charges very fast-can sync to 2 phones, but i haven't tried it.-local Costco is selling it for $60 right now.-great range from phone - i can leave my cel charging and walk around the living/dining/kitchen with no static.CONS:(all due to small size & weight)-not as comfortable as H710/15/20 series - ear clips aren't padded-harder to slip on your ear one-handed quickly (eg driving), if you leave it in your pocket.-relative light weight feels like it might be easier to break down the roadAll in all, i'd get it again.  To me the only downsides are those that come with the convenience of a very small headset, with no downsides in audio function.  If i was only using it for driving, maybe i'd get something that's easier to slip on one-handed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Good, Very Small Headset (former H715 user)", "unixReviewTime": 1306108800, "reviewTime": "05 23, 2011"}

Downing", "helpful": [12, 16], "reviewText": "UPDATE(11/4): So I repurchased the SIII shortly after iPhone 5 was announced as I realized that it would still be the best phone available for quite some time. I've had it (again) for just over a month now and I'm absolutely in love with it. I purchased an extended battery that I've also reviewed and it makes this thing a tank for long travel, etc. I don't know whether the firmware was updated or if my charging habits have adjusted but I rarely even use the extended battery getting satisfactory performance from OEM battery nowadays. This is an amazing phone. I also went with the Pebble Blue this time around and that's a much better color in my opinion. Not enough bezel to make the white look as good.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I owned a 16GB White Samsung Galaxy SIII for approximately 28 days before I reluctantly returned it. Previously I had owned an iPhone, iPhone 3GS, and an iPhone 4. So let's talk the SIII.The hardward design is fantastic. The device is super slim and very lightweight. Seeing the phone and it's magnificent screen, you initially think it's going to be very heavy and bulky but it's really light and thin. The plastic backing helps with the weight savings yet doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. The form will simply be too big for some, but for those that really enjoy using a smart phone the massive screen is a dream come true.The Android 4.0 ICS is great and really responsive allowing you to multitask and switch apps like a pro. I've noticed that implementation of some functions is not quite to \"Apple standards.\" I use that analogy not because I think Apple is the gold standard, but because that was my previous experience. For example, the Bluetooth seemed much less relaible skipping much more while using my headphones. Additionally, the device seems to struggle with wired audio as well having playback loss when connected to my car stereo. I will say that I can't be sure whether the issue with these are hardware, firmware, or the particular app I was using. The beauty of Android is that you have more flexibility but that flexibility can make it difficult to identify a culprit when things are not up to expectations. Also some of the stock programs like the email and text message are not great but having Android allows you to easily enough swap them out with many of the free alternatives in the Play Store.The 4G LTE is fast. Amazingly fast. Faster than my home Wifi. A joy to use but I was surprised that you seemingly could not disable it where you were concerned about saving battery.The camera is worthy of point and shoot status taking brilliant pictures.So why on Earth would I return it? The answer is battery life. I'm not techie enough to know whether the battery itself is insufficient or the SW is not optimized to preserve battery. All I know is that the thing just drains in standby, even with all the background apps killed. I didn't think this would be a big deal as I always charge at home and have spare chargers at work and in the car. The last straw was when I fell asleep after a late night charge but without charging overnight. Both times the phone was dead when I woke up. Coming from the iPhone, which has its own battery issues but will usually last through the night uncharged, that was simply unacceptable to be left with a dead phone after only 7 or 8 hours of standby.So as much as I love and want to keep this device (and generally hate Apple as a company), the bottom line for me is that it's a phone first and nothing is worse than a dead phone. I may re-purchase the SIII if some attractive aftermarket battery options become available but for now I had to return it and preserve my phone upgrade for something that gives me a little more juice.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Updated: A Clear Winner in a Sea of Smartphones", "unixReviewTime": 1344038400, "reviewTime": "08 4, 2012"}

The living room has 2 chargers, the kitchen has a charger....its utter chaos!  Now with family visiting, its even worse!  People fighting for \"prime charging outlets\".  While family is over for the holidays I've counted 3 ipads, 3 android tablets, and a 10 phones (android and iphone).The convenience this little savior brings can not be put to words.  Being able to charge 2 tablets and 2 phones at 1 location is amazing.  Placing the charger on the side table really declutters the house.I decided to get a central charging station that anyone could use.  So here came Ravpowers 4 usb port charger.4 ports designed to charge iPad and tablets (2 x 2.1A)iPhone and Android devices (2 x 1A).Total combined output of 6.2A (Ports are specially designed for the labeled device but also charge many other devices at full speed).Compact, unibody design for added portability.Industrial-grade plastic outer shell and premium circuitry ensure lifetime reliability.AC 110-220V input voltage ideal for international travel.Package contents:RAVPower 4-Port Wall Charger, 3.84ft / 117cm detachable power cord, user manual.It's a pretty bare charger.  Power cord, central charging hub and a manual.  No frills to keep cost down.I ran a series of tests between:Iphone 5Nexus 5S3S2Droid BionicIpad 4Ipad 2Nexus 7galaxy tab 3All combinations of tablets and phones were able to be charged without a problem.  No hiccups or lags, everything seemed to be charged a normal pace.Build Quality:Very sturdy, with a good weight to it.  It's not too light where it would slide and shift around on our glass table.  Nothing creaks or seems flimsy at all.  It has 4 non-slip pads/feet at the bottom to prevent it from sliding around.The blue led is on the bright side as you can tell from the pictures.  It's ridiculous trying to look at it, maybe a soft green would have been better.While it did not come with any micro usb cables as all of us have dozens laying around.  It'd be a nice to have short cables like in the pictures so it doesnt get to messy around the charger.It gets warm but never too hot to be concerned about it.Value:For 20 bucks I really dont think you can beat it.

I've even applied screen protectors using the identical three layer process.  I have never had a problem.  Yet I just spent an HOUR trying to successfully get one of these useless things on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  I'm on protector number two and will have to try my third and last, but I'm thinking I'm out 10 bucks and my time and I'm feeling frustrated and even angry.The protector is so thick and rigid that when I try to smooth the \"1\" backing down as I ATTEMPT to install the protector, the whole protector lifts off the phone (the backing isn't tacky enough to resist its desire to straighten), ruining the carefully placed alignment. I finally removed more than two inches of that backing so there's enough to actually stick to the phone.  I thought I actually got it but there were HUGE air pockets around the edges of the phone.  In error, I thought I could \"buff\" them out, but it's impossible (and no, they're not from dust).  And NOW, there's no protective backing so the entire screen protector needs to be lifted and re=smoothed with the whole thing exposed to air and potential dust.  I suspect this is design related with the protector being a bit too wide.  The slightly raised lip of the Galaxy Note 3 makes it impossible to get the protector flush against the sides of the device, so it lifts (air pockets).  You can try to smooth out the huge air gaps but they return again and again because you can't get the protector 100% flush against the phone.The first protector somehow got a hairline crease in it, so I had to try a second protector and experienced the same air pockets.  Now, dust has inevitably comes into play from my many frustrated attempts to fit this stupid thing (dust removal stickers are a sick joke - they do NOT remove dust from the protector's tacky side at all), so I'm going to have try the third - and I ALWAYS get protectors installed first try.  I've never needed to go to a second, never mind a third.Unless you enjoy futility, frustration and wasting money, AVOID.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Would give it zero stars if it were an option", "unixReviewTime": 1381968000, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2013"}

I've been using it with an S3 equipped with a basic gel snap on case. I'm running CM 10.1, so I can't attest to any Samsung specific dock apps. I purchased the optional iBolt AMPS plate so I could attach it to a Proclip mount. I very badly want to like this dock...especially with the money invested in it and the AMPS plate. However, there are a few problems with it that give me reason to look elsewhere when it comes time to purchase a new phone and the associated dock accessories, etc.The USB cable/plug on the actual dock is too long and stiff for the S3. This necessitates pushing the S3 as far to the side as possible in the mount - in order to remove any slack in the USB attach point. If I center the S3 in the mount, there is then slack in the USB elbow...which makes it bunch up slightly...and with the stiffness in the cable....the USB plug will not sit flush in the port on the phone and it quickly pops out.Having to keep the phone all the way over to one side also puts pressure on the extendable feet on the bottom of the mount. Now the foot on the side of the mount where the USB plug is, will not stay retracted....causing the phone to loosen in the mount or sit at an odd angle.Based on the above two issues it appears that the S3 is on the extreme minimum size end of the phones that can use this mount. An S4 or more appropriately - a Note - would probably fill up the mount sufficiently to eliminate my two primary complaints.Unrelated to the size issues - the interference via the charging/auxiliary cable is severe. The static and cell signal sound can make listening to an audio book an exercise in mental fortitude (akin to having nails on a chalkboard in the background).

Hermit \"Seeker of the one pure and cl...", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I received this well-machined (metal housing of outstanding build quality), aesthetically pleasing, mid-range (5600 mAh), external battery with a handy form factor about 2 weeks ago and have been more than pleased with its performance while putting it through its paces since then.It's just slightly more one-half the capacity of another such item by a different manufacturer that I reviewed some time ago [OXA Juice Box S2 10000 mAh Safe External Battery 18M WTY Premium Samsung Cells Digital Screen & Flashlight All-in-One charger external portable power supply, (5V 2A and 1A USB Output) Mirco USB connector and more - see my review)], but is much more portable because of this and can be easily slipped into an available pocket for readily available on-the-go use.Although this LiBa battery comes with a USB cable and all the connectors that you will need on a daily basis, you will very likely find that the cable provided is a bit on the short side when used in combination with charger and a standard wall outlet. It's not long enough to let you either rest the battery comfortably on the window sill or place it securely on the floor with a bit of slack. Instead, it just sort of hangs there in no man's land. This will usually not be a problem since most people will have at least one longer USB cable available, but including such a cable in the package itself would be a nice touch.The device comes with 4 light blue LED status lights that flash while charging and are all a solid blue when the battery is fully charged. Each illuminated LED - when checking the charge - represents an approximately 25% increment of the battery's capacity. A handy little LED flashlight for spot illumination is also built into the housing; it can be turned on and off by twice sequentially pressing the single power/control button. If you follow the incorrect instructions for turning the flashlight on and off provided in the enclosed instructions (depress for 3 seconds to turn on or off) you will not accomplish anything whatsoever and eventually begin to think that the LED bulb or the battery itself is defective.Although the short USB cable provided may be just the thing for charging the battery via a USB port on your PC, I much prefer using an external charger which is much quicker. After this external battery was fully charged, I first used it on my Moto X smartphone which had been depleted to 55% of its full charge. It took this LiBa battery about 1.5 hours to return my smartphone to the 100% level after which all 4 battery LEDs were still illuminated. A second attempt with this same smartphone when it was at 25% of its full charge took 2.25 hours to return it to 100% after which 3 of the 4 battery LEDs of the previously fully charged battery were still illuminated.I also plugged my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 when it was at 56% of its full charge into a fully charged LiBa and achieved a 100% charge on my Kindle after 2 hours 40 minutes. The external battery lost at least 50% of its charge (2 out of 4 LEDs illuminated).A nice improvement to this unit would be the addition of a second higher rated 2A charging port for quicker charging of items such as the above-mentioned Kindle tablet. As it stands, the device only has a single 1A output (best for smartphones) for this purpose, but it does get the job done; it just takes longer to do so.I should also mention that the English instructions included - although short - are quite understandable, something that is not always the case with items manufactured in China. The aforementioned OXA external battery was quite atrocious in this regard.Certainly this LiBa 5600 mAh Cell Phone Portable Charger - External Battery Charger Pack holds more than an adequate amount of power in reserve for all those occasions when an AC outlet to plug in your cell phone or other charger is nowhere to be found and a car charger also is not a viable option - most definitely a recommended item.Note that the manufacturer provided me with a sample battery for review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "LiBa - reserve battery power for those on the go", "unixReviewTime": 1396569600, "reviewTime": "04 4, 2014"}

So, extra battery packs seemed just the thing. I got this plus the Overnighter (Duracell Powermat GoPower Overnighter Backup Battery, Power Bank for iPhone 5S/5C/5, Samsung Galaxy S4, Other Smartphones and Tablets), just for backup - as advertised. I had previously been using the &#34;Energizer PP-IP4SB iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 Charging Case,&#34; which, unlike these Duracell Powermat devices, doubles as a phone case.  The only thing I didn't like about the Energizer, was that it added a  bulk and weight to my phone which i didn't particularly care for, so i thought i'd try out these other backups.  Well, after a few weeks of carrying this Daytrip around in my purse, and using the Overnighter on travel, I decided to go back to my Energizer despite the added weight and heft.  For me, it turned out that the convenience of having the battery already stuck to my phone outweighed the inconvenience of carrying the additional weight. Also, the Energizer gives me about a 90% charge up. I'll discuss the Daytrip here, and my review for the Overnighter under that webpage separately:The Daytrip charges my iphone 4S to about the 65-70% within an hour or so (pretty quick), but never goes above that amount no matter how long i plug it in for- it stays on 1 blue bar for nearly 10 hours or more, but does not add but a few percentage points or so more to my phone power after that initial hour. Additionally, it is a tad bulky (like a makeup compact) in my purse- i sometimes try to avoid carrying a purse, and the added &#34;thing&#34; to carry in my pockets gets a bit much to juggle. If you don't like to carry your whole house in your purse, or don&#8217;t carry a purse or murse (man-purse), you may find this an issue as well....but that's individual.  On the other hand, the Daytrip conveniently has the charging cords built into it, so that you don&#8217;t have to also carry around a separate usb cord. An additional plus is that after a few weeks of not using it, it still held the 4 bar charge, and charged my phone back to that 65-70% level just fine.Good:-quick charging in an hour-separate usb cord unnecessary-holds full backup charge for weeks very wellNot great for me:-another thing to carry and possibly lose or misplace-only 65-70% charge capacity for my iphone 4S from empty-relatively bulky in my purse or pocket", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "an extra thing to carry", "unixReviewTime": 1387324800, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2013"}

We do not warranty that this case will protect your device in all circumstances - user exposes their device to hazards at own risk.

Ensure complete closure and inspect case for damage after impacts. Under no circumstances will LifeProof repair or replace a damaged device. This case is not a substitute for regular backups or insurance.I know companies have to cover themselves from dumb users who always want to sue for everything, but the disclaimer pretty much tells you: Ok dude, whatever we said in our advertisement, may or may not work for you. If it does work, cool, you got lucky! If it doesn't, deal with it.Now, focusing on the product alone, I can tell you that upon receiving the product, packaging was awesome, I think they spent a big chunk of their money on it, looks good!

I can tell you however, that it does look like it seals all the potential leaks.

{"reviewerID": "A25C2M3QF9G7OQ", "asin": "B00BB5GQRE", "reviewerName": "Comdet", "helpful": [59, 64], "reviewText": "Power banks are becoming pretty common these days and basically all work the same: they house one or more lithium batteries which you charge via AC current, then use the power bank to charge a portable devoice, such as a phone, tablet, etc.Since the overall operation is so similar, power banks distinguish themselves mainly on design and ease-of-use features. In these regards, the Intocircuit does a very nice job.The power bank offers 11,200mAh of power which gives it enough capacity to cover a few charges of a small device (such as a phone) or one charge of a larger device (such as a tablet). In my case, I use it mainly to keep my Kindle Fire 8.9 charged, and it does a capable job - for example, it brought it from 30% to 80% charge while still retaining enough capacity to recharge my Samsung phone from nearly empty to full.But, pretty much any power bank of a similar mAh rating could do the above tasks. What I like about this one is the overall design - it looks nice! The case (I have the gray one) is metal with a brushed finish. The end-caps are plastic, but have a softness to them. The overall affect is that it feels and looks nice, rather than cheap and \"plasticy.\"It's more compact than other power banks I've used in this power range. It measures about 4.5 inches tall and 2.75 inches wide. It's pretty thick - just shy of 1 inch thick. It also has some heft, weighing in a 9.9 ounces. Unfortunately, size and weight are the prices paid for more capacity, but this power bank does a good job of keeping things manageable.All the ports are at one end. It offers two outputs (1 is 2.1A; the other is 1.0A rated), an 5v in connection and a LED flashlight. The ports are well-attached with no wiggling or give even when I put a lot of stress on the cables. On the front is a decent-size, clear screen that shows a battery icon with the charge level. It also indicates which ports are in use. There's an on/off button, but it's not necessary to turn it on to use - it has an auto-on feature that engages the charging as soon as the cables are attached.You can use the on button for the flashlight (press it twice rapidly to turn on the flashlight). It's a nice touch since I'm often using this in a car and an extra light to see the ports is helpful. It puts out a decent amount of light - more than enough to see where what goes where when inserting cables.The power bank comes with an assortment of the usual attachments to cover a range of devices. I won't list them here since they are in the product listing. I only used the micro USB cable (which worked just fine and felt decently made), so I can't speak to how well the other attachments work.It also comes with a soft pouch that is large enough to hold the power bank plus a few attachments. I was especially pleased to see that it comes with an AC adaptor - other power banks I've used skip that. The adapter is compact and fits easily in the pouch. The amp rating for the adapter is not listed on the adapter nor in the specs.There are some misses:1. The lettering for the port power output (1.0 or 2.1 amp) is black on black and VERY hard to see unless there's bright light. I stuck an adhesive dot next to the 2.1 port so I could easily spot it.2. The on/off button is very small and feels cheap, unlike the rest of the power bank. While it is not needed much since this is an auto-on devoice, a larger button with a better \"click\" feel would have been nice.3. The screen is clear but the screen cover is thin and flexes. Again, it introduces a somewhat cheap feel to an otherwise solid device. The screen is also a fingerprint magnet (unlike the case, which is fingerprint-proof due to the brushed finish).4. No power rating for the AC adapter.I'll keep the rating at 5 stars since these misses 1-3 are mostly cosmetic; miss #4 is more of my curiosity than an essential issue. It's a decent power bank that is worth considering.[Manufacturer provided sample for review]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An attractive, nicely-designed power bank", "unixReviewTime": 1365206400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2013"}

The material is hard plastic, not slippery, and will provide moderate to high protection for your iPhone: bumps, drops, whatever, it'll be safe.

Since the manual is small, I am giving you helps here on how to use this should you buy this speaker.Also, I am able to leave my micro SD card in the speaker's slot, I use the MULTI MODE BUTTON to change the mode and also play from this speaker while it is charging.**This unit uses a MINI charger port meaning that any mini USB charger will fit into the port and charge up this speaker. Since I had an extra Motorola Mini USB Wall charger, I plugged this into my unit and it charges it well and it charges very quickly.PROS:+ MULTI MODES AND USES ETC FOR THIS SPEAKER - Bluetooth, Auxiliary and Micro SD Card:1) MP3 Player/SD card mode - To keep the SD card in the unit when it is turned on it will automatically see that there is a card in the unit and play music from the SD card. If you want Bluetooth instead just press and hold DOWN the Play Button, then the Bluetooth with turn on (you will see the blue lights flashing fast so you can then pair and connect without having to remove your SD card.2) Bluetooth Mode. If you Do Not have an SD CARD in the unit, when you turn on the speaker (on the bottom of the speaker) it automatically turns on the Bluetooth mode so you can pair. You will know this because the blue mini lights flash very fast.3) Auxiliary Mode (this is for your Audio cable to listen to a radio or CD Player etc). Step one: Plug in your in and out cable to the speaker and your CD player, radio, etc. You will need to press the Play (multi mode) button and hold it down. The speaker will realize that it has an audio cable in it so it will be ready to play in regular mode in the speaker (like a regular non Bluetooth type of speaker). This means that you can now play your radio or CD player etc through the speaker (make sure that you have the In and Out Cable (included with speaker) plugged into the speaker and the CD Player etc).4) + Charging - This Bluetooth speaker came with USB Charger cable and charged very quickly (less than 2 hours for a full charge).Charging suggestion - This unit comes with USB charger that you can plug in to a computer to charge the unit. However, since I always have micro USB chargers lying around the house, I used one of my micro chargers and plugged it into the wall to charge. It charged much faster that way. Also, most any brand of micro USB charger should work fine on this unit and it charges very quickly+ Pairing/Connecting - The speaker very quickly paired with my tablet, phone and MP3 player in just seconds!+ Sound Quality / Loudness /Adjusting the loudness- For a very small personal speaker, I found the sound clarity excellent and the sounds of high and low notes good to very good. In fact the sound of this tiny speaker is VERY LOUD better than I expected for such a very small speaker!On this speaker, there is a volume control.  *To up the volume hold down the + Key, to lower volume, hold down the - Key.5)To go to next song, quickly press the + key, or to go to previous song, quickly press the - key.+ Phone Reception - When I had my phone paired and I was listening to music, then my phone rang through the speakers, I was able to use this as a hands free speaker.

It is a little wider and thicker than a deck of cards, but not quite as tall. It easily fits in a pocket.There are three ports on it, two output standard USB ports for connecting to devices to be charged, and one micro-USB port for charging this device. There is a 4-segment LED display which shows battery life and whether the unit is charging or discharging, and one switch for activating the LED display when the unit is idle. There are no other switches or ports of any type.===My Test Results===I tried this unit with three devices-A third generation iPad, an iPhone4, and a Kindle Keyboard (the slightly older model with the greenish screen).The Energizer unit arrived about 60% charged, and took about 3 hours to fully charge.From a fully discharged state, the Energizer unit needed 6.5 hours to fully charge.It charged my iPhone (from 20% to 100%) in about 2 hours, and used up roughly half of the capacity. The energizer unit was able to give two complete (20%-100%) charges of my iPhone on a single fill-up.It charged my Kindle in about 3 hours (from the point where the Kindle warns about battery life to a full charge indicator on the screen -see note below). Again, that seemed to take about 50% of the Energizer's capacity based on the status LED's)A full charge on the Energizer was only able to get my iPad from 15% charge to 40% charge, and that took about 3 hours.===The Good Stuff===*It works as advertised, especially for the iPhone and Kindle.*The status bar LED display is easy to read. It is sort of shaped like a battery, with a small square at the top. When the lights are flashing \"up\", it is charging, when they are flashing \"down\", it is discharging. The number of LED's that stay lit indicates the current battery level.*It is small enough to carry without a whole lot of effort.* The little magnetic wire holders are sort of neat, but I could live without them quite easily.===The Not So Good Stuff===* I am not a fan of the microUSB connector for connecting the unit to a power source. I am sure they did it to make it easier to distinguish the input from the output, but since I usually don't carry one, it is one more cable to add to my bag. There is a marking on the unit to identify the input port, but you better have good eyesight...I never noticed it until just now when I looked for it.* The display gets a little annoying. It is flashing when the unit is either charging or discharging. Besides chewing up a little valuable power, it is just one more LED trying to ruin my quest for darkness. My hotel room looks like a Christmas tree now.*On the iPad and iPhone, the unit shut off (LED's stopped flashing) when it was finished charging or ran out of juice. On my Kindle, the light on the Kindle indicated that it was still charging, but the Energizer LED's were shut off. The Kindle appeared fully charged. I guess a man with two charging indicators is like a man with two clocks...you never really know.*Would have been nice if it had a little more battery kick.* The two USB ports for charging devices have a limited use. Every device I tried slowed down when connected with a 2nd device...not sure what devices draw so little current that the Energizer unit can supply two of them. I guess it might come in handy if you want to let two devices charge overnight, and are less concerned with total charge time than having to get up at 4AM to switch plugs.===Summary===It works well enough that it will get tossed into my travel bag-sort my stamp of approval. More battery life would have been nice (as usual), but an extra two charges on my phone can come in handy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works well enough, a little light on capacity", "unixReviewTime": 1348876800, "reviewTime": "09 29, 2012"}

I'll be upgrading soon.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I don't like to waste money. And that's exactly what I was doing when I had a typical phone contract. When I switched to the Google Voice/Skype/Gophone setup, I ended up saving about $40 a month and that made me happy. For the longest time, however, that meant enduring communication on a ghetto 1990s phone (the best value I could find for the Gophone). However, when my ghetto phone died recently, I was forced to review the market again and I came across a remarkable gem: the AT&T; Fusion.Not only did it fit well into my money-saving Google Voice/Skype/Gophone scheme, it also had a camera (score!) and was able to handle the internet like my iPod. I went from needing 3 devices when I went out down to just one. It's a testament to the free market that such a product is available for so little moolah. $130 for a small computer that can take pictures and upload them to Facebook. Oh yeah, and it also can make phone calls.There are some serious drawbacks, namely the fact that there's only 200 MB of internal memory on the phone, which is used for apps and text messages. Seriously, we're talking about tera a petabyte devices now; the last I heard of something at the MB level was my Commodore 64 from 1987). If you have too many apps, you can't receive text messages and that's excruciatingly annoying. You can move the apps to the SD card, but that requires some tech-savviness that most consumers don't have the patience for. Also, I had an issue moving my SIM card to this phone from my ghetto `90s one. Text messages didn't come in for a while and it was difficult to figure out what was wrong (AT&T; customer service was actually very good here). I've also had problems with receiving data over the 3G connection.The greatest thing about this device, however, was the brilliant GPS feature. A user can download navigation directions when connected to the Internet, then when driving around the middle of nowhere without a data connection, the navigation app will direct him flawlessly (evidently the GPS feature is free though data would cost).All in all, this is an excellent buy and will only cause a few minor headaches if you're used to more capable devices.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "It's Amazing What the Free-Market is Capable Of", "unixReviewTime": 1344816000, "reviewTime": "08 13, 2012"}

Put my phone in and no power.  My multimeter is not working, so I can't tell if it is the plug-in adapter that is not sending power, or if it is the dock that is not working, but either way it doesn't work.  Unfortunately, this is following a pattern of several motorola products I have owned, hence my skepticism in the original review.  Bummer, but at least I will hopefully be able to get a new one under warranty.This is a pretty neat dock.  It is very pricey, compared to the regular (non HD) dock, but the ability to hook it up to your widescreen TV is pretty cool, and the best part (reason I bought it) is that you can hook up USB peripherals.  I had my doubts about this USB feature, but I have 2 different wireless mouse/keyboard combos and both of them work flawlessly with this dock.  My laptop crapped out last week, and I had to research buying a new one using the bionic's webtop app (firefox browser), since I didn't have the laptop to surf with (obviously), and this worked great.  My new laptop should arrive in 3 or 4 days, but in the meantime, this will tide me over.  One big concern I have is the wall plug-in to this dock.  It is not the USB-type like the other docks I've had were.  This is a proprietary plug.  I assume they had to avoid a USB power source, as most USB sources don't have the amperage needed to power this thing, then everyone would return it as \"broken\" when their underpowered USB port fails to run the dock.  Anyway, the power connector is a tiny rod, smaller in diameter than a toothpick (by quite a bit), and it would not surprise me if that tip would snap off easily, so I try to be very careful when packing it into my luggage.

Using Bluetooth wireless, there are no wires to get tangled in or get yanked out, they're sweat-proof (not waterproof--don't wear them in the rain or shower!), and they do stay in your ears if you set them up with the appropriately-sized extensive hardware that they come with to fit your ear size.  I wear them at the gym and they've never popped out.  The cord sits on the back of the neck.  It doesn't bother me much, although I'm not crazy about feeling a rubber wire rub on my neck every time I move my head.As Jaybird acknowledges, the range of the signal isn't more than a few feet--you can't use these while leaving your phone in one place and walking around the house.  But it's weaker than that: you have to keep your cellphone on your right side, on your waist or on your arm, for the signal to work.  If you keep it in your pocket, it cuts in and out.  That alone makes it virtually useless if you don't care to wear a belt clip or arm band.Some have said the sound isn't quite as good as the previous (and less expensive) model; I don't know because I didn't try those, but the sound quality of these is just OK. They're tuned with the treble relatively low, so there's little sizzle in the highs. Without question, if you're looking for anything close to audiophile quality with deep bass, full mid-range, and clear, crisp highs, these aren't designed for you.  For the price, there are other phones with much better sound, so I would recommend these only for people who really want not only the Bluetooth feature, but also the stay-in-your-ear, sweat-proof features, since that's a large part of what you're paying for.  I'm sorry to say that those who've complained that the sound isn't much better than cheap buds aren't exaggerating very much.These charge through a USB connection that uses a miniUSB port covered with a tiny plastic plug on the body of one of the phones.  I find that to get the plug into the port, I have to shove the plug away and jam the plug in, and the plug pushes against the plug.  I wonder how long that plug will last.The buds come with a very fancy little clamshell holder.The controls are tiny and confusing.  The features work, but rely on pushing tiny button controls on the right bud housing, and it takes some practice to, say, hit the right button in the right way to answer a call while you're listening to music.  It can be done, and it's convenient when you operate it as intended, but you do have to be motivated to figure out the multifunction controls and use them properly (those who already use Bluetooth headsets have a head start.) Pushing a button short, medium, or long causes different effects. I'd prefer a larger, simpler set of control buttons.  Not to mention better sound quality for this price.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Just OK Buds Recommended Only for Working Out", "unixReviewTime": 1351209600, "reviewTime": "10 26, 2012"}

Yes, there is a disclaimer that it can discolor but I expected this to happen over a year or longer, not in 2-3 months! It turned from clear to a dirty, dingy and smudged looking case. It looked like I permanently smudged the back of my phone and it was showing that way through the case. I was truly disappointed in this. If diztronic knows the case may be prone to discoloring, I think they shouldn't sell it at all; a disclaimer isn't enough. The most I can do is warn others interested in this clear case to NOT BUY IT. There are many other alternatives to try.

It's not enough to fully charge an iPad, but the USB port on it is recognized by my iPad and it does start charging slowly (1.5A instead of the 2.1A the iPad requires). The battery itself is insanely thin and will fit in most briefcases and pockets. A small power switch turns on the battery, and if there is a load, it will stay on until the device charges. It will turn off once charge is complete. Four blue LED's indicate the charge status, and if you double-click the power switch, there is a white-LED built in as a flashlight.  This was a great little idea.The battery charges through a micro-USB port, but does not come with a wall adapter so you will need to get one (EasyAcc has a nice selection on Amazon). In addition to the 1 regular USB port, there is a yellow cable that is permanently attached with a micro-USB connector. In other words, carry the battery and unless you are charging an Apple product, you probably don't even need to carry a separate charging cable.

The battery capacity is huge, wonderful for recharging my cellphone (a large capacity Samsung Note 2) back up to full charge several times.  It is about the same size as my cellphone, so I can easily carry it in my cargo pocket of my pants for recharge. It has a four-LED indicator which shows the charge status, 0%-25%-50%-100%.  It is charged either by built-in solar panel or plug-in through a USB charger.  It is light weight, has a black plastic body with matt surface solar panel.. one button on the face, and two USB outlets on the bottom (one for charging the battery, one to plug in to charge a phone from the battery).Two things I would critique.  The curly cord that comes with it has a detachable head which lets you change from mini-USB to micro-USB head.  It works, but it is one more loose little part to lose.  And unfortunately, even though most cellphones and devices use micro-USB... the socket in the Opteka is a mini-USB port.. which means you need both, if you want to charge the battery pack first by USB, then use it to charge your phones.Second concern is the solar charging ability.  While it is technically possible, you will find that the solar panel is probably too small to efficiently and quickly charge the huge 4000mAh battery pack.  It took almost all day to charge it back to about 75% capacity.  If you think you will be able to set it out in the sun and have a full charge in a few hours, it probably won't happen.  Maybe this feature is good in an emergency situation, or where you might tie it to the outside of your backpack during  a day of hiking, for most people it isn't that practical.  Good backup feature to have, but I think you will find yourself more often charging it via USB and then using through the day for your devices.

Both last amazingly and get better with training time! I read a recommendation to charge 100% and keep charging for at least a couple more hours to begin the battery training, so this is how I started both batteries. I let them run down to the 20+ percent and recharged like the first charge for a few times. The Blackberry Tour battery has performed right from the start, and only improved from there. The Pre Plus battery held charge all day and I recharged in the evening overnight. Because of my Blackberry use (I just used as I normally would) I thought I needed to push the Pre Plus battery more by uber-using it all day; Pandora, texting, calls, browsing and playing games to run it down. The next day it performed better and each day has improved. Now I am using it as I personally would normally use my device. I really appreciate Seidio extended batteries! The back cover for the Blackberry added a little more bulk, but the Pre Plus back cover has definitely added more. Since I am new to Palm Pre Plus and I started with the extended battery within a few days of using it I can only say I don't mind the bulk. My daughter tried it and said it makes it easier for texting (she is the one who gave me a Pre Plus) and it made the phone a lot chubbier, but the cover looks nice on the phone. I think the Pre Plus cover looks nicer than the Tour cover, but only because of the latch on the Tour cover. Maybe Seidio should have made the latch black also on the Tour cover, instead of the \"silver-ish\" paint they use now.

I still can't decide if I'm going to return it or not [UPDATE: I returned it, see below]...and here's why:PROS:-It looks nice. The leather-like finish and styling of the case add more class to the device. It's drawn more than a few compliments thus far.-S View works are promised, as well as I would expect from even a Samsung branded product. I really do like having the S View features...I will find it hard to switch to any other case that does not offer S View. I love being able to answer calls and see the time/notifications from the little window.-It offers protection for the back of the phone that the Samsung version does not. While this does add a little more bulk, it's not a big deal to me and I'm quite OK with it.-I love that the screen turns on and unlocks automatically when you open the cover...and then when you close it, it shows the S View time/notifications/battery/signal etc. for 5 seconds before the screen turns off. Not hitting the power button is something I appreciate often!-The \"kickstand\" functions perfectly for me. I have never had it slip at all when using it. I use it every night as my bedside clock, propped up with the case stand, and it never falls. I watch videos in this positions etc. and even when I adjust the angle, which is a nice feature itself, it seems very stable. I think some other reviews who have problems are propping it up incorrectly? To be clear, the front of the case goes face down on the surface and you place the left side of the phone on top of it, at an angle of your choosing.CONS:-FIRST AND FOREMOST - this is the DEALBREAKER (almost) for me. Sometimes when you have the flip cover open and folded back behind the device, [I believe] the magnet/sensor is still triggering the S View function. This happens VERY consistently when the phone is placed on a metal table or object with the cover folded back underneath it. The result is that you get stuck with the phone thinking the S View cover is over it and the screen is locked, showing you only the S View window...despite the fact that the actual S View cover is behind the phone, not on top of the screen! You then have to momentarily remove the flip cover from the back of the device to allow it to reset to normal...again: this happens sporadically in most cases but consistently when placed on a metal surface.-SECOND AND NEARLY TIED FOR 1st - this is another DEALBREAKER (almost) that I am frustrated with: the case messes up the compass. I cannot get a proper reading with the compass even when performing the figure-8 manuever to re-calibrate it. Once I remove the case, it starts working again.-The S View window is indeed a fingerprint and lint/dust magnet. You can clean it with varying degrees of success. I don't hate this, but it's a small annoyance.-The flip cover itself does not lock in place when closed over the screen...it can move about 1 centimeter out of place up and to the left or down and to the left and about 1/2 centimeter directly left. Despite this, it does not trigger any issues like the screen turning on (thinking the case has been opened) and has had no real effect on my usage...it's just an obvious little quirk. Unlike the Samsung flip cover that I used on my S3, it has no issues with the cover not wanting to close all the way after being folded behind the device.-As everyone has pointed out, when the flip cover is opened and folded behind the device, it partially blocks the camera, making it not an ideal way to take photos. Even if it didn't block the camera somehow, I wouldn't want to take pictures through the clear plastic S View portion of the cover...due to the previously mentioned fingerprints/dust/lint. When taking photos I just let the flap hang freely below the phone and it's not much of an issue aside from a small inconvenience.-The \"spine\" of the case blocks access to the volume buttons...so you have to open the flap.-A bit of a double-edged sword here: the power button. Upgrading from the S3 to the S4 I immediately felt that a power button I did not like before had gotten even worse (I feel it doesn't have enough tactile feel to it and is too hard to find/press and not clicky enough to let me know I really pressed it). The case has a cut out around the power button so you can access it...but it makes the button become recessed within the case, making it even harder to press than before. The other side here is that the S View flip cover itself makes pressing the button a less frequent need (see PROs above).OVERALL:If not for the magnet bugginess (CON # 1/2) this would be a solid 4 STAR review and I'd be quite certain to use this case for the entirety of my S4's life...I'm going to contact the manufacturer about that issue and see if it's a defect or a design flaw I'll have to deal with...I will UPDATE this review accordingly. Please post in the comments if you are also experiencing the inadvertent triggering of the S View display while the cover is folded behind the device and/or errors with your compass when the case is attached! Thanks.UPDATE:So far, excellent customer service from the seller, Rearth. I am replacing my current case with a new one to see if it's without the magnetic defects. I will update this review once I have tested.UPDATE 2: Rearth has been a good seller and helped me through this problem. They offered to send me a replacement case upon receiving my original, but I needed a case to protect my phone. I opted to purchase a 2nd case from them to compare and decide whether the original was defective or not. Unfortunately, the replacement case did not perform much better.It seems to me that part of the problem is that a brand new case still has some rigidity in the \"spine\" that keeps the phone slightly elevated from the magnet in the flip (when the flap is folded behind the phone and laying on a surface). After a few days or weeks of use, however, that rigidity is gone and the phone just lays flat against the flap. This exacerbates the magnetic issue...despite that, I was able to duplicate both defects on the brand new case.Anyways, I've posted two Youtube videos explaining the defects. Feel free to search for jeffr3ii and check out my \"Jeff Howard\" channel.I am returning both cases for refunds and looking for another product. I am sad to leave this one behind because I really do like it...the defects just ruin it for me, however.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Lots of PROS and lots of CONS - 3 weeks of use RETURNED", "unixReviewTime": 1369094400, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2013"}

{"reviewerID": "A2PR5G1680ISEY", "asin": "B001QXDSMW", "reviewerName": "David Arnstein", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "Update: As of 2010-10-14, Motorola S305 headphones are available at a price that is approximately the same as these Sony 'phones. There is now no reason to choose Sony. The Moto 'phones are equal or better in every aspect. In particular, the Moto 'phones stay on your head easily.These headphones offer good performance for the price. As other reviewers have noted, there are significant problems with this gadget. I suggest a work-around for some of these problems.Sound quality: not great. I have a pair of Sennheiser PMX60 mini-headphones that have better bass and a more \"detailed\" sound. But these little Sennheisers are about the same prices as the Sonys: http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PMX-60-PMX60-Headphones/dp/B00009LI55/ref=sr_1_45?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1264384037&sr;=1-45.Construction: these headphones are built light. They are suitable for doing chores around the house, brisk walks, and so forth. For use during all out exercise with sweat and motion, I'm just not sure.Fit: as other reviewers have noted, these 'phones fit the head very loosely. tilt your head forward, and they will slide right off. There is a related issue too. The drivers inside those big fat foam pads are tiny. You must position the drivers precisely over your ear canals, or the sound will be worse than \"not great.\" It will be terrible.My suggestion: in light of the above issues with fit and positioning, I recommend the use of a jury-rigged \"leash\" to hold the headphones securely on the head of the user. Such a leash fits the back of ones head. I fashioned my leash out of a cut-up Croakies eyewear retainer. I uploaded two photos to this review to illustrate my work, such as it is. I have used this idea with other headphones and I have had good results in all cases.Compatibility and stability: I have paired these headphones with three devices. The pairing process was effortless. These 'phones work well with my Motorola cell phone, my iPod Touch, and my notebook computer. In fact, I have used these 'phones with my cell phone and iPod at the same time. Listening to music, when a phone call comes in, I can touch one button on the 'phones to answer. Very convenient! With the notebook computer, I can use the controls on the 'phones to do pause/resume, skip forward/skip reverse, and volume up/volume down. With the iPod Touch, I can do all of these except skip forward/skip reverse. By the way, you cannot use the microphone function with the iPod Touch either. Just Apple being Apple, I guess.On the subject of iPod, here is a trouble-shooting tip: while listening to music with my iPod Touch, I encounter frequent dropouts. What happens is that the sound ceases for about one half of a second. It is irritating, and it happens to me several times per hour of use. The solution is to disable WiFi on the iPod Touch. It seems that the iPod bluetooth and WiFi radios have trouble working together. The \"dropout\" problem is especially bad if the WiFi signal is weak. It seems obvious to me that this is an iPod problem, not a Sony headphone problem.Value: these are the only stereo bluetooth headphones I can find that are fit to purpose AND less than $100. Sony also gives you a telephone quality microphone. In fact, I got these for a lot less than $100, so I consider this to be an excellent value. Frankly, I wish that there were more choices in the marketplace. No matter. The marketplace is what it is, and this product is the best deal that I could find.I suppose that I have presented a rather conflicted view of this product, but I am getting a lot of enjoyment out of it. I like to wear it while doing chores around the house. With conventional wired headphones, I have issues with my arms getting tangled in the headphone leads and pulling the 'phones or music player out of place. These Sony headphones are much more pleasant to use.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "(No longer) Best bang for the buck", "unixReviewTime": 1264291200, "reviewTime": "01 24, 2010"}

Because it is so thin, I imagine it will not absorb as much impact force as with other cases. But the thinness is great if you don't want too much added bulk.  The case adds about 1 mm thickness around the sides and the back of the phone.  The top screen is not covered by the case and so no addiitonal bulk is added there.  Also, the case is covered in a plastic that has slightly more grip than the phone's plastic.  It's grippy enough that you don't feel like it'll slip out of you hand, but it's not too grippy that you can't get it out of you pockets.One thing to be aware of is that this is a tight fitting case.

People hear me loud and clear.In the state of California you may not talk on the cellular phone (oh thank you) while driving, hence numerous bt speakerphones are popping up like weeds.  I bought the blue ant from amazon a while back and in my vine review they asked me to look at the plantronics.  Each has strengths and weaknesses.The blueant is clearly the winner here - it just sounds better, and in fact, being an audio snob, I do not detect the blue ant as being a speakerphone when it is used.  Everything sounds normal.  BUT there is a big piece missing - the blue ant is geared towards the newer i-phone / g-phone devices and leaves out the older designs by motorola with metal cases and ease of use.  The good part is that the audio quality is SOO good with the ant that you can actually speak to your phone and have it understand you - my plantronics earpiece couldn't be recognized by my older phones!Now plantronics has entered the world of visor clip, cig charger speakerphones.  They did some neat things - like having two microphones.  While I guess that is meant to improve the performance, sadly it doesn't.  The plantronics speakerphone sounds like a speakerphone, and not holding the phone to your ear despite all their magic dsp technology.  I was enthused that a company like plantronics would \"get it right the first time\" but it's a speakerphone - no doubt.It does have some features to access your telephone (again, i/g phone) directory quickly which seem to work, and it does have some neat features if your phone is dictating directions to you - you can press a button and listen to them on an unused FM station in the car.  Unfortunately  - by the time the phone synthesizes the voice, puts it over bluetooth 2.1, then the plantronics modulates it over FM - well - you know the rest of the story - it doesn't sound as good as using the speakerphone inside your phone itself.  It's just LOUDER.I own probably close to 6 BT devices and none of them live up to their reputation of being a crystal clear perfect audio link.

Felt its experience?  Felt its longevity?  Held that rock and didn't want to put it back down?  Dropped it in your pocket to carry as your \"worry stone\" or your \"pet rock\"?  You have to check out the design of this U-Stone power bank--it has that feel, that presence.  Seriously.If you have spent any time looking to purchase an external battery for your devices, you already know that most of them are black, bulky and not so great in the looks department.  Along comes the Lepow company, whose motto is \"Make technology more enjoyable\" and whose designers are among the best in the world.  (This product won a Red Dot Product Design Award** for 2013.)  This U-Stone, with a whopping 12000 mAh of power and a convenient 1.8A output, is the best designed and most interesting-to-look-at external power bank that I have ever seen--or held.It feels (and I wish Amazon would allow italics, because that word \"feel\" really needs it in this instance) so very wonderful in the hand.  It has a matte, not-quite-smooth finish, that has a softness about it.  Its graininess looks like sandstone, but doesn't feel as rough as a sandstone would.  It is like a river rock, worn smooth from hundreds of years of rushing water experience.  And like a beautiful, worn river-rock, I want to pick it up, grip it, and hold it and hold it and hold it.And the design is not only on the outside:  This U-Stone uses lithium polymer batteries, and inside the case, those batteries are double-walled, plastic and flexible, situated in an efficient circuit design and space arrangement to allow heat to disperse evenly and to prevent leakage.  Even the packaging is a well-designed layer upon layer, and environmentally friendly, being made from 100% recycled materials.  Another very interesting design feature:  There are NO buttons to push.  Plug it in, it starts to charge.  Shake it, and the blue LED lights turn on to tell you how much power remains, (4 of them, each representing 25% of stored power).I wanted a high-powered external battery to charge my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", and the U-Stone handles that responsibility with ease.  If I want to use the Kindle while it charges, I need to use my own, longer USB cable than the one that comes tucked in the recessed end of the case.  What comes with the case is a convenience only, I think, as it is only 6 - 6 1/2\" long and the tabs are a bit hard to grasp.  It also charges our household's variety of iPhones and a potpourri of bluetooth speakers.If this will be your first experience with an external battery, you must understand that as the mAh increases, so does the weight.  Are you looking for something for your evening bag or to tuck into your pants pocket?  This is not what you are looking for.  This mighty power bank give you a huge charge; you pay for that convenience by carting around a case that weighs 11 ounces and is about the size--a little slimmer--of an eye glass case.  You can't fault it for being this size:  You want the power?  Then the size and weight are what you need to learn to live with.  Now, the day Lepow designs a powerful charger at half the normal weight, THAT will earn another Red Dot** top award!**What is a Red Dot Award?  The Red Dot Awards is a German-run non-profit organization.  Companies pay a registration fee to submit their designs to a jury of 40 well-qualified individuals.  There are many, many categories.  Lepow won a Red Dot Award in the Product Design category.  If you get nothing else out of my review, I hope you will at least go visit the Red Dot website.  It is enlightening and a revelation--to say the least.*I received a sample product from Lepow.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Superbly designed with the powerful and comforting feel of a river rock", "unixReviewTime": 1396656000, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2014"}

They've also opted for a very no-frills approach - there is no speakerphone feature, and the T1 doesn't have any built-in or SD card memory options for local music playback. It simply has one task, and it performs that quite well - playing audio from your connected device.Connecting via Bluetooth is a very simple process: you turn on the device by holding down the button in the middle, and then you hold down the play/pause button for a few seconds until the Bluetooth light starts blinking red and green. The speaker is then in pairing mode, and your phone/tablet/computer should be able to see it in the available devices list for its Bluetooth settings.Except for the power button, the buttons are touch sensitive. On the plus side, that keeps crevices and areas where gunk can accumulate down to a minimum. However, I still prefer analog buttons that you can feel positively press down. With touch sensitive buttons, I always feel like I have to pause slightly between button presses when turning the volume up and down. That's just a personal preference, though. The touch sensitive buttons are volume up, volume down, previous track, next track, and play/pause. Aside from the power button, the other buttons only function in Bluetooth mode. In wired mode, the connected device controls all playback and volume settings.The speakers sound good at all volume levels, though they start to get a little bass distortion at the very highest volume setting. My only complaint is that when not actually streaming audio, they emit a static sound while clicking through other menus, screens, etc. on my phone. It doesn't affect the streaming audio fidelity in any way, but it is a little distracting and annoying at times when browsing through my playlists for a new track.In Bluetooth mode, the volume can be set independently on the speakers and on the connected device, so you will need to set both devices to their highest volume settings to reach maximum output levels. Due to its upward-facing design, this speaker systems work best indoors, where its speakers can resonate and fill the room with sound.If using the speakers while watching videos or gaming, you'll most likely want to use them in wired mode. While the video-to-audio lag over Bluetooth isn't quite as noticeable as some other speakers I have tested, it's still present and may bother the more keen observer.The manual mentions USB charging, but the speakers actually come with 120v AC to 5v DC wall adapter with a round connector plug. It works well and has a long cord, but I would have preferred a more ubiquitous miniUSB or microUSB charging connection in case the included charger was ever lost or damaged. Plus, I already carry around a microUSB charging cable for my phone, so that would have made it so I had one less thing to carry around.I'd rate these speakers a solid 4 out of 5 stars overall. The static sounds over Bluetooth while navigating menus and the non-USB charging port are minor annoyances, but they aren't deal breakers by any means. If you're looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker system with more output than the standard \"Jambox\" two-speaker design, the RoverBeats T1 should definitely be on your consideration list.Review disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product for the purposes of examination and review. No review or particular rating was promised in return, and the opinions expressed here are my own following my fairly extension first-hand experiences with this product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice midtone fidelity in a slightly larger and more powerful portable speaker than the \"jambox\" types", "unixReviewTime": 1394841600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2014"}

This is a slightly rugged for moderate protection (not the Ottobox type of ruggedness though). It comes with a quality screen protector for the front, a plastic squeezer and a cleaning cloth. The instruction sheet is minimal but it's pretty easy to figure out how to install the case.The screen protector has a protective mask on both sides with tabs #1 and #2. First, remove the mask with tab #1 and then apply it to the iPhone screen. Then remove the mask with tab #2 to expose the touch side of the protector. Any trapped air bubbles can be squeezed out with the supplied squeezer. The screen protector has precision cutouts for the home button, the receiver slot and the front camera. It is glossy and has a very, very slight purple tint to it.The case itself is made of black Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) shell mated to a white hard plastic outer layer. Installation is as easy as putting the left side (buttons) of the iPhone into the case and then push the right side into the case. The elastic TPU shell of the case makes this installation very easy.The case is well built with precision. The black TPU and white plastic part are mated together without any visible seams. The back of the case has a big cutout in the camera/flash area that is designed not to effect any washout by the flash. Due to the thickness surrounding the cutout, the camera/flash is recessed enough to discourage any accidental stray fingerprints. The back of the case resembles some military gadget with black rivets in them. At the center is the UAG logo in a brushed aluminum accent.The case has a little ruggedness to it. At the four corners are slightly bulkier to absorb impact from small drop. The edges of the case are raised up such that when the iPhone is placed face down on a table, the screen would not be touching the surface.The case has a rectangular opening for the ring/silent button (button would be recessed in the case to prevent accidental switching). At the bottom are three openings for the headphone jack, the lightning dock and the speaker. The power and +/- volume controls are covered with raised buttons built in the TPU. Pressing those buttons are very easy with little effort needed.It's also interesting to note that the case has honey comb pattern in the interior of the case. Perhaps it is there to reduce the weight of the case while providing some ruggedness. The case is thicker than most cases in the market (except Otterbox and other bulky ones designed for extreme protection) but it still weighs extremely light.We like the UAG iPhone 5 case a lot. It is very light and provides moderate protection without excessive bulkiness. It fits the phone well with high precision. It also comes with a high quality screen protector for a complete protective solution. This white case matches the white iPhone very well in offering a black and white color scheme.

This means you still have a normal headphone wires that go down past the chest length into the device. The earbuds are the shape of the old rounded hard plastic style with a small round peice jutting out with a slightly larger then medium silicon cover on it. The peice tht juts out goes into your ear. I had trouble with the earbuds falling out, so I used them without the silicon. This made it rough, but I didn't really feel anything & at least stayed in my ear whereas with the silicon cover, even not moving the buds would fall out. Now you can use your own headset, but I'm not sure if you can plug in one with a mic or just use regular ones & not be able to use the mic. Again, the design of this is horrible.Using the buds/hooks:Are a bit of a pain to change. The hooks & 2 cushions do NOT work on the stereo earbuds, ONLY the mono device.  This makes no sense.Caller Sound:It sounded a bit distorted/far away, like talking to the person sitting next to the person you're on the phone with in a car, but dealable. The caller on the other end agreed. This does have an automatic volume regulator as if it gets really loud, the sound decreases for the caller. Once normal sound is on your end again, the caller will have a hard time hearing you until the device raises the volume again. This happens without hitting any buttons. If you have the stereo earbuds in, the call will come out of both sides.Videos/Music:Using the stereo earbuds for music/video sounds more clear then using it on a call, it's a bit tinny, but not distorted like on a call.Use with an Iphone:Though this says andriod, I got this because it says it works with all bluetooth devices such as MP3s even. This DOES work with an iphone with limits, even the voice commands work to dial, pairing was easy. When you answer a call, you get a choice on the phone to switch between the bluetooth, speaker or handset. I had trouble with muting, etc. voice commands during a call. Hitting the talk button on the bluetooth only automatically answers the call, no choice to ignore. I haven't tried call waiting yet, I could mute, but not unmute, etc.)Electronic details:It can connect to a phone as far as 33 feet it claims & lasts up to 6 hours of talk time OR 180 hours hours on standby on each charge.Has a 1 year limited warranty.LEDs: It blinks when on & indicates blue for good battery, purple for medium battery power & red for low battery power.You can mute a call by holding the volume up or down & will beep until you unmute it.You can switch between the bluetooth & phone itself by holding the talk button.Conclusion:Poor manual, not enough buttons to make using it easier, poor use of earbuds/hooks, poor design use when converting to stereo earbuds, a bit distorted on call sound.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Samsung HM3700 - distortion & poor ease of use", "unixReviewTime": 1316649600, "reviewTime": "09 22, 2011"}

I was able to unscrew the plastic nut and remove the magnet from this mount and put it on another with a longer arm.The magnet works great.  It's seemingly rather powerful, pulling in the metal plates with a good bit of force, but not so much that you have trouble dislodging from the magnet.  The magnet also has a bit of a smooth, silky, rubberized coating, so there's not a loud snap or a worry of scratching.To get your phone to stick to the magnet, you have two options.  The first, which I use, is a round metal disk that you place between your phone and your case (thus, this method requires a case).  The disk is about the thickness of maybe 5 sheets of paper.  The second option is a pair of rectangular metal pieces with rounded corners that have adhesive pads on the back.  You can place these between a phone and case or adhere them to the back of a phone or case.  All of the metal is nicely machined and has no rough or sharp edges.In my case, I use this mount with a Galaxy S4 in an Urban Armor Gear case.  I have the round disk between my phone and case, which does interfere somewhat with NFC, but there's enough of the battery exposed that I definitely still can use NFC.  I just have to be aware of where NFC works on my phone.The case I have is relatively slick, being hard plastic, and it does allow my phone to rotate very easily on the magnet.  This can be mildly annoying, but is also kind of nice at times.The bottom line, though, is that the convenience of just stepping into my car, popping the phone on and then popping it off as I get out is magnificent.

However, I noticed that I could easily run my battery down to nothing on days when I needed to talk and use the internet heavily, especially when traveling. I had been looking for some kind of battery back up system when I got the opportunity to review the Spyder Battery Case.The battery case itself is surprisingly sleek - not really any bulkier than the Otterbox Defender I had been using. However, if you cherish the ultra-slim nature of your iPhone 4s, you may not like the bulk this battery case adds. It is heavier than a regular case because it has a battery incorporated into it. It's made of a rigid, satin finish, rubberized polycarbonate and fits my 4s perfectly. The cut outs for buttons, camera lens and speakers align exactly. The case has metal contacts in the bottom for using with the charge/sync dock and a mini-usb port for charging without the dock. There is also an on/off button on the back and 4, blue LEDs which indicate charging status and level of remaining charge.If you wish to set up the dock as a charging station without connecting to your computer, you will need to purchase a usb power adapter (the usb cable is included). However, you can simply plug the charging/sync dock into a usb port on your computer and eliminate the need to buy a usb power adapter. I LOVE that my phone inside the case sits securely in the dock for charging. Previously, I have been plugging a charging cable directly into the proprietary Apple charging port every night, but was worried as I have heard that it is easy to damage the port. This is so much better!So how well does the battery work? It more than doubles your iPhone's battery capacity!!! The iPhone 4s has an internal, 1432 mAh battery. The Spyder battery case adds another 2000 mAh of battery power to your phone. Fantastic! It is an A-grade, lithium-ion polymer cell battery for larger capacity and more charge cycles.Spyder recommends that you let your iPhone drain to 20% capacity or less before you turn on the Spyder case. My phone was up to 100% (from less than 20%) in a little over an hour and there was still juice to spare in the case!I am absolutely thrilled with this case and dock. It meets all my needs and more and keeps me from having to even think about my phone battery, no matter how much I use it in a day.The only negative I have is that I wish the case had an extended lip around the screen of the phone and was maybe a little less sleek and a little more protective. I am used to a Fort Knox level of protection with the Otterbox Defender. The Spyder battery case sits flush with the screen, so if I drop it on gravel or other rough surfaces, there is no protection for the front of the phone at all. Hence, I had to buy a screen protector. (My Otterbox case had a screen protector built-in.) But for more than doubling my phone's battery life and the convenience of a charging dock I can just sit my phone in, I'm thrilled and I am more than willing to be a little more careful with my phone.I HIGHLY recommend this item.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Two big thumbs up!", "unixReviewTime": 1337904000, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2012"}

You also get a lifetime warranty like Zagg. You get 3 protectors unlike Zagg. Only costs you $10, unlike Zagg. Zagg just lost one and iSmooth just got one.

Besides color, there are subtle differences in sensitivity, length, barrel size, weight, and attachment clips or lanyards.  Sensitivity depends on two things:  (1) whether the rubber capacitive tip is soft or stiff, and (2) what device you are using.  I find that a stiffer tip works well with an iPad, and a softer tip works well with a 1st Gen Kindle Fire or a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet.It isn't necessary to pay a lot for a stylus.  Some inexpensive ones (e.g.,3 pcs Aqua Blue/Black/Red Capacitive Styluses) work better with my iPad than more expensive ones (e.g.,Marware Capacitive Stylus for Kindle Fire, Black).  Unfortunately, when you buy \"generic\" styluses like the ones in this listing,  you don't know exactly what you'll get, even if you are reordering from the same seller.  On the other hand, if you buy generic styluses, you can easily afford to replace them when the tips inevitably wear out with use.  (The rubber tips soften, and sometimes the tips will loosen and push back into the metal ring and barrel.)These generic styluses are an incredible bargain, but the tips are mushy (very soft) out of the box.  When I use them with an iPad or Nexus 7 tablet, it feels like the tips are flattening out and allowing the metal ring to contact the touch screen.  This isn't really happening, because the rubber is still between the ring and the screen.  However, I don't like the feel at all.The 10 metallic styluses are attractive: you get 2 each in aqua, black, red, pink, and purple.  They are 4-1/2\" long, have a comfortable-to-hold barrel, and include a nice pocket clip.  They ship from Hong Kong, but mine were dispatched immediately and arrived within a month.  Because the tips are so soft (and will only get softer with use), I rate these styluses at 3 stars (\"It's OK\" on the official Amazon scale).  However, at the price of three dollars for 10 styluses (the price when I purchased mine), you can't go wrong by trying them.In case you're wondering, as I was, what a \"capacitive\" stylus is, it is a human interface device (e.g., a mouse) that uses \"capacitive sensing\" to measure changes of position on a touchscreen.  It works just like a human finger on a touchscreen device, and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus.  Wikipedia has good articles on capacitive sensing and capacitive devices.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great Bargain, But Capacitive Tips Are Very Soft", "unixReviewTime": 1357344000, "reviewTime": "01 5, 2013"}

We had to order & pay for another battery from a store in St Lucia. So now it works fine however the casing is very very flimsy. you have to be very very careful when you take the cover off to put in the SIM card or you will bend the casing and it will break easy. Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove. You can do video calls on this phone but it does not have a front facing camera so you have to turn the phone to the backside so the person you are talking to can see you.What a disappointment because the main purpose for buying the phone was to save money on international calls by using Skype or other free video calls.  :-(", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Casing flimsy - Battery BAD", "unixReviewTime": 1387324800, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2013"}

Some cover the entire phone as to protect it from accidents that may occur to it, or from unintended misuse. Others wrap around so that they cover the parts that can get scratched most easy but leave the screen bare as to not dilute it too much. This Belkin case takes more of the latter but minimalizes it as much as  possible.The case is transparent (visibility about 8.5/10) and has a more hard rubbery-plastic feeling outer shell. Installation is simple as all you do is 'snap' the case on the back. It is so simple that you really do not know when it is fully on because there is no 'snapping' feel or sound. You just know it is on when it does not fall off when you pick up the phone. As easy as it is to apply this case to the phone, it is as just as simple to take it off--or get it knocked off.The Belkin sheer keeps scratches off the back case and does not make itself appear too bulky. The Galaxy III is an already sleak phone and the shield sheer does not hinder that really.While making itself have a more 'small' character, it sacrifices a bit because if you hit the phone, bump the phone, or hold the phone the wrong way, you will have a case that is barely hanging on. Other than the latter, it works well as a simple case that does not take away from the natural appeal that the SIII has.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Simplistic Functionality--If It Stayed On", "unixReviewTime": 1350345600, "reviewTime": "10 16, 2012"}

Even though you are supposed to be able to put the battery in and make sure one contact is on negative and one is on positive and it will charge this always isn't the case. I have had to flip the battery sometimes and then it will work.

On a couple occasions this has happened and when I popped the battery in it's device it had never fully charged.

That isn't a surprise since they're both Sony products. The 20 watt output of this speaker is honestly just a number to me, but it fills up my main room with no problems and without having to put on maximum volume. The fidelity is great with incredibly clear treble and bass - the separation of the two leads to overall top notch clarity. I tested this with the Beatles LOVE album and it handles the array of soft, hard, orchestral, and mixed arrangements seamlessly. I can hear individual instruments perfectly, rather than the mush some portable speakers I also own. I don't know how Sony does the stereo separation in such a small unit, but it's pretty cool.Finally, I charged this speaker fully, turned up the sound about half way, and did get over 7 hours of play time (I had to go to bed).

Now what puts this  Jabra speaker  apart from the others  is the attention to details in its design.It has a NICE SOLID FEEL.. not like some of the plastic speaker I have had  to try out. This Jabra feels like a unit that will works well if you sort of bump it around a bit.1. it has  a strong, thick, non skid rubberized base that will keep this little fella firmed seated where ever you put it ..  I tried it out in the car and it did not budge from my dash board through  out the ride2. In-bedded in the base is  the cable to  do a direct connect with your phone or tablet or computer  and no blu tooth is needed so you won't misplace this cable it can be returned to hits hidden track on the bottom of the unit.3.the 3 button's( volume control and paring button) on the top are large enough to easily feel them and use them but they sealed so no crumbs or sand etc will enter the button mechanism4.when you turn the unit on it has a SOUND ( some music ) that lets  you....know it is NOW ON5. when you pair this speaker with a blu tooth  it TALKS to you to let you know it is ready to go  and once paired and connected it again SPEAKS to tell you it is ready to gonow if your device is NFC enabled this unit only need a TOUCH and you are connected.6. the sound.... now this is what your most interested in............it has a nice range of sounds .. spoken words are clear( I listened to a audio book with it ) and then a range of .... music from the classics's, Broadway tunes, hard rock and soft jazz  and all of it was nicely blended w the appropriate amt of bass.7.  once charged up...  you have a good 8 hr of play time.. NICE>>>>>>8.  you can use the Jabra as a speaker phone  paired w you cell phoneI can see this unit being a faithful companion for me .. . I am really impressed with the tone of this unit .. It compares favorable with my Bose speaker... The Bose still has a better  separation of sounds but if I did not have the Bose to compare .. this Jabra would have completely Blown me out of the water ..I can say, without hesitation, this is one GOOD SPEAKER............

Shipping was extremely fast and the product was well packaged. I've read a lot of the reviews of aftermarket batteries on the tech forums and Anker seems to have a good established reputation. I avoided QCell even though it has NFC because it is full of blatantly fake 5 star reviews. It may or may not be a good product but I refuse to give a seller that relies on deception even a single dollar.I haven't had the phone long so only time will tell if it will maintain its capacity for any appreciable length of time. It comes with a 1 year warranty so I guess that is time enough to tell. If it maintains its current performance and declines the way the stock battery normally would, then it is well worth the price. It makes no sense to me to purchase $30 batteries that claim a dubious additional 200mah when you can buy 3 generics that are just as good as stock for the same price.NFC is not that prevalent right now so it is a non-issue for me. Maybe once the deal between Google and the ISIS consortium goes through it will be more widespread. However, to me it makes no sense to have to unlock my phone and swipe it, enter a password, and pay rather than to just pay with my credit card. What happens if you run out of batteries? Also, it just puts your phone more at risk of being dropped it situations like drive thrus. I think by the time it gets wide spread enough, it will be time for a new battery or phone.P.S. When looking at reviews, especially for generics that come from Taiwan/China, look at the reviewers history.

I've been a big fan of the Motorola H-series headsets, having owned pretty much every iteration. I really tend to prefer the headsets that wrap around your ear for support, because it means I don't need to have something digging deep into my eardrum.I've generally not been very impressed with Jabra's Bluetooth headsets. I own a couple of Jabra Supreme Bluetooth headsets, both with surprisingly varying call quality, and a Jabra Stone, with questionable battery life and mediocre call quality. For reference, my current favorite Bluetooth headset is the Motorola H730. Or should I say - it WAS my favorite.The Jabra Motion UC is in another league to all the above headsets.The phone I tested it with is an iPhone 5s.First, the box for the Jabra Motion UC is insane. While it pretty much guarantees your phone won't be damaged, it's perhaps rather unnecessary - a giant plastic hard case. It does look pretty swanky, though! Once you get into the box, you're presented with a smorgasbord of bits and bobs:1.) The Jabra Motion UC headset itself2.) A tiny Bluetooth receiver for your laptop/desktop computer3.) Two different-sized ear pieces for those of you with larger/smaller eardrums4.) A micro USB cable5.) A separate micro USB wall adapter6.) A cigarette ligher charger8.) Zip-up travel case (with room for the micro USB cable)9.) Quick-start guide.I have to give Jabra a LOT of credit for the absolutely complete package of accessories this headset comes with. Well done, Jabra!Moving on to pairing the device... A very simple affair. Press the talk button on the headset while flipping the boom down, and the headset goes into pairing mode. I was then able to pair it straight away with my iPhone 5s. Opening the boom mic connects it to the phone, and closing the boom mic disconnects it. Simple. (For those with other devices, this thing even has NFC, which was a surprise to see)An added bonus for iPhone users is that the Jabra's battery life appears on the iPhone bar at the top next to the phone's battery life. As far as I'm aware, this is a feature that only works with Jabra headsets.I did some call-quality tests with a friend of mine across the country, and these are our results:1.) There is absolutely no crackling or popping on my end or his end at any normal distance. I was able to move a full 30 feet away from my phone before even a hint of crackle entered into his end of the call.2.) The noise canceling works absolutely brilliantly. In my bathroom, my friend could not tell whether I was using the iPhone 5s itself, or the Jabra Motion UC. Switching to the Motorola H730 my friend could easily hear the echo of my bathroom. The Jabra performed better than any other headset at noise canceling.3.) Call quality is excellent on both ends of the conversation. My friend said the only minor difference between the iPhone 5s itself and the Jabra Motion UC is that the Jabra lacked just a teeny bit of low-end.4.) I was concerned that the mute button being on the end of the mic would cause issues with people hearing the click or rustling when I mute or unmute the headset. I can happily report that after testing this thoroughly and repeatedly in a quiet room that my friend simply could not tell that I was pressing the mute button.Some other things to note:1.) I have a little facial hair, but there was still a nice gap between the mic and my face. I imagine if you have a decent-sized beard this may be an issue, but it was not an issue for me at all.2.) If you wear thick glasses, the wrapping around your ear might not be amazingly comfortable, but I imagine this is very subjective. I wear thin-frame glasses, and the comfort level is good.3.) If you tap the \"Call\" button, it will tell you your battery life in your ear (starting at 7 hours). After about an hour of use, I pressed the button and it told me I had 6 hours battery left. Half an hour later, it told me there was 5 hours and 30 minutes, so it's at least pretty accurate!4.) A full charge takes just 2 hours.5.) Motion-sensing auto-answer is set to on by default, but you can turn it off if you're not interested or it's just \"not for you.\" Just download the Jabra app from the App Store and disable that function. I like the feature, but only after practicing putting on the headset within 2 seconds of picking it up!6.) When people call me, the Jabra speaks their name, and I'm able to answer the phone by simply saying, \"Answer.\" There's a bunch of commands, but you'll want the manual to see them, which you can get here:[...]7.) The earpiece can be pulled down a little (it's on a stem) from the wrap-around part, which wasn't obvious to me until I read the manual.8.) No annoying flap or cover over the micro USB port on the headset. Just grab your cable and charge the headset without having to fiddle around.Overall, this is by far the best Bluetooth headset I've ever used, and it works fantastically with my iPhone 5s. The only concern I have with the device is that it's not cheap, but considering you get a really nice bunch of accessories - that does help lessen the sting at least a little.Overall: 5 out of 5.

My regular phone is a T-Mobile HTC Radar 4G. I had come from the iXX and Android worlds and I really like the Mango system so much better! I'm not technical at all but I find Mango easier to use and the tiles just much easier on my eyes, too! The Lumia 800 looks just awesome in person; I'd say it's the best-looking black-color phone, ever! Its slightly elongated shape and super light weight and solid feel make it feel perfect to hold, whether for surfing or calling! The screen is bright and beautiful, and the touch screen works really well. I do need to get a screen protector, though!Two things I don't quite like, though: 1) it uses a micro-SIM card which is very difficult to find at low prices, I had to search around hard for a reliable seller; 2) the camera, while it has superb optics as it's a Zeiss, gives incorrect white balance under artificial lighting, while my HTC Radar has very good auto white balance. Outdoors, the Lumia 800's camera works wonders. Oh, one thing I don't get, which is not important for me as I don't use Tango and currently Skype, owned by Microsoft, is still not available for Mango, is there is *no* front camera. My HTC Radar has a VGA front camera but its picture quality is abysmal!The Lumia 800 does have quite a bit of storage. If you want to load a lot of media files, you should consider the HTC Titan. If you just want to download apps the Lumia 800 has enough storage for you. WinPhone's games are definitely so much more sophisticated than those on the other platforms, so the XBox Live titles do take up quite a bit of space.

I've used one from time to time and have helped several family members learn to use them and occasionally do minor trouble shooting for them, and they're really solid devices overall.One of the best things in Samsung's favor is that they take keeping their devices updated pretty seriously. The Galaxy S4 is in the process of being updated to Android 4.4, where some manufacturers seem content to toss an Android device onto the market and then pretend that they have no idea that updates are a thing that should be happening. This will be a less severe issue down the line, because Google is restructuring the operating system a bit to make it easier for them to handle updates themselves rather than leaving a lot of it to the hardware companies, but it's still nice to get something from a company who's serious about their obligation to provide a good experience even after they have your cash in hand.Other than that, this has a lot of nice features. The screen is good enough for just about anyone. It handles opening and running apps at a nice pace. There's a simplified interface that hides a lot of the apps and noise, which can be good for people who find smart phones a tiny bit overwhelming at times. You can use it with a Miracast tv/receiver to mirror the screen on a tv to show off things like photos and videos without asking people to crowd around a tiny screen. The camera is excellent for both photos and videos.The screen is just a bit large for people who put a very high priority on portability and using a phone one-handed. On the other hand, this size is just big enough to be reasonably comfortable for people who struggled with the teensy tiny touch keyboards on the earlier generations of smart phones. Whether you like the way Samsung makes Android look is a matter of personal taste. I like the Google Nexus devices just a little better, but Samsung's approach is a very long way from the worst that you can find on the market.On the whole, while this isn't my personal device of choice, I've been really pleased with them. I tend to be the person providing tech support for my family members, so I've used them many times and I've had the happy experience of not being stuck putting in a ton of time trying to get them to work as they should. I occasionally tweak a setting here or there and do little things like check to make sure everything's been updated properly, but on the whole the Galaxy S4's in my life have been about as close to trouble-free as any piece of electronics I've encountered.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Holding up Nicely", "unixReviewTime": 1389744000, "reviewTime": "01 15, 2014"}

The included cables should be used in the 1 A port for optimal speed when charging non-Apple devices and Apple cables should be used with Apple devices.Output is up to 3 A simultaneously. The power output is shared between the 2 A outlets so if both of them or all three ports were used simultaneously, charging would be limited to 1 A per device. Practically, there is little reason to charge more than 2 devices at a time.Two cables of different lengths and two micro-USB tips for recharging the juice pack were thoughtfully included so the cables can be left in different locations such as at home and at the office. Several other adapters are also included for charging electronics from the power bank. The juice pack itself can charge from a USB port on a computer or television or from a USB wall adapter. It is a smart charger that will turn itself off once it reaches capacity. I was pleasantly surprised that it was delivered already fully-charged. When completely discharged, it will recharge overnight from a USB wall adapter.There are four blue LED indicators to show how much capacity remains. After charging a Samsung cell phone that still had half a charge and an iPod shuffle full discharged, all four indicator lights were still on, which demonstrates the high capacity of this model.As a bonus, there is a bright-white LED flashlight that is very useful and makes this power bank ideal to keep in the glove compartment for emergencies.The only tricky thing is that it is necessary to remember to press the button to turn it on for charging. The glossy finish does show fingerprints (I like that rubbery soft-touch finish on electronics) and the instruction booklet is in small print. It appears to be made as well as it works, definitely of excellent quality, and it certainly feels substantial in the hand.

The Samsung Galaxy S4 is known for the amazing screen resolution and its high-pixel camera. After putting the screen protector on, you can definitely notice the presence of the screen, since it dramatically reduces the clarity of the display. Pictures are not as eye-popping as they used to be (without the screen protector).

I gave my Commuter case to my sister after she cracked her screen and she loves it. No issues with camera or microphone holes, both are cut to fit pretty precisely. One caveat is that it is a little hard to push the buttons at first, but it gets softer once worn in and hasn't posed any problems. Also, since the back is hard plastic it can be fairly slippery, and can't be placed on a tilted surface without sliding, even on my lap on the train. That is the main advantage of the Defender case which I replaced it with.I got the Defender case for myself thinking it would be much better, but because the soft rubbery layer is on the outside it is prone to stretching. It is still a great case and I haven't broken my phone (though I've dropped it literally dozens of times - on rocks, on the train platform, on carpet, on bathroom tile) which is a pleasant change for me.The customer service is also great - when the outer case did stretch it was within the year warranty so I just uploaded a picture with my name and address pointing to the defect and Otterbox sent a new one. I presume they would do the same for the Commuter Series.

The Otterbox Commuter Case arrived in pristine condition and was obviously brand-new.  It fit the Razr Maxx perfectly.  It was easy to assemble/put on the device.  The screen as well the surroundings are all protected.I realize that this review is about the Commuter Case, but I wanted to share my rationale for purchasing it after I had such a positive experience with the Otterbox Defender, so please skip this paragraph if this is not a concern of yours.  I currently have an Otterbox Defender for my iPhone 4S (I actually purchased the case for my iPhone 4 (CDMA-Verizon) and saved the case to use with my upgrade to the 4S.)  This item has protected both phones so well- especially considering the fact that I have dropped each one on more occasions than I would care to admit.  It's a bit clunky, I will admit, but considering how often this has fallen from at least 5-6 feet onto concrete or asphalt, it is an absolute must for me.Back to the Commuter Case.  I read the reviews and because they range from stellar to less-than stellar, I was a bit hesitant to purchase this case. However, I had purchased the Commuter Case for my son's iPhone 4 (the one I handed down to him so that I could upgrade to the 4S  =) and he loves the case. Both the case and the iPhone have survived his freshman year in college.  I am equally (very) impressed with the way the Commuter Case for the Motorola Driod Razr Maxx fits the phone.  I purchased this as protection for my husband, who is a minimalist and wanted the least amount of bulk possible to protect the phone.  He is pleased with the cover as it is lightweight, fits the keys exactly, and provides the needed protection.Because he is not the klutz that I am, he will probably rarely if ever drop his phone thus will most likely never require the protection the case provides.  In fact, his phone/case will probably not even end up with a scratch on it.  But for peace of mind and total protection that does not add bulk- I can't think of a case better designed for it's function.  Oh, and by the way, it's a great looking case as well.P.S.  I now need to go back and write a review for the Otterbox Commuter Case I mentioned above that I purchased for my son for his iPhone- he survived his freshman year and so did the phone, thanks to the cover!!!

My first impression of the case was that it's a bit thinner than what I've come to expect from Otterbox, but coming from someone who prefers a thinner profile this isn't a bad thing.The exterior of the case has rigidity but isn't a typical hard plastic. The case has internal support which allows it to have a softer exterior without compromising rigidity. The exterior is textured which makes the phone stay more securely in my hand.The case came with a screen protector. This went on easily and free of air bubbles, thanks to the included \"squeegee\". If I'm being nitpicky my only gripe about the screen protector is that it's not any too big. I would have liked it to be just a tiny bit wider (it barely covers the corners from left to right) but it does cover the entire screen and that's what's important. After a couple weeks of use the screen protector is still securely in place and isn't showing any signs of clouding/scratching or peeling. My screen still looks crystal clear through the protector.A few highlights:The front of the case is raised away from the screen which allows me to place my phone face down on a surface without having to worry about scratches or damage.The cutouts for the various ports and speaker/camera on the back are perfectly cut and clean. The cutouts for the camera on the back are also raised allowing me to place the phone face up without having to worry about damaging the camera lens.I like the carbon color of the case. The color is a very dark gray and looks nice on my white S3.A few gripes:The width of the screen protector (as noted above).The side buttons are harder to press with the case on but the design offers more protection this way so it's a trade-off.The exterior of the case does show scuffs/scratches due to the material but they wipe off with a damp cloth.The case does add to the size of an already large phone (Case thickness measures at approx. 1/2\") but this is to be expected with any case that offers a level of protection.Conclusion:Overall I'm very happy with the case. I feel like my phone has an adequate level of protection without too many sacrifices.

Together, these frequencies cover Europe, much of the U.S. and many other countries. Most tri-band units, however, are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.850 fills in the 'rural gaps' in The States. 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia. Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900. They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they don't provide a needed frequency... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.How is T-Mobile? Truth of the matter (as with any mobile phone service) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in. Sorry, there is no across-the-board answer. As soon as one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.Visually, this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone, but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys.

Many of us leave these \"energy vampires\" - like VCRs, DVDs, cell phone chargers and other things, plugged in all day long. They drain our electricity and rack up our electrical bills! How can you know how much money they cost you? The answer is the Kill-A-Watt device!P3 P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor Operation of this device is VERY easy. You lug the Kill-a-watt into your power outlet. Then you plug your electronic toy into the Kill-A-watt! That's it! Instantly the device starts figuring out how much electricity the electronic object is using - EVEN WHEN IT IS OFF. A lot of devices like cell phone chargers sit there drawing electricity all day long.For example, I leave my laptop plugged in all day. I have it \"shut down\" - but it's plugged in. It turns out I'm paying $3.76 a month to have it sitting there. I know that might not sound like a lot, but if you start multiplying that by all the other objects in your house that stay plugged in, it can add up quickly.Just how much is that old computer of yours costing you? It might actually be MUCH cheaper to buy a new one that consumes far less electricity, rather than powering the old behemoth every month! You could be amazed at the amount of money you can save, just by unplugging some things when they're not in use. Invest in some power strips with on-off buttons. Turn them to OFF when the items are not in use, and see your savings soar.I love that you can program in your current electrical cost - this is always found on your electrical bill. So for my home in Massachusetts that is $0.187 per kwh. The device then lets you see - at the touch of a button - how much the current object will cost you each hour, each day, each month, each year. The longer you leave the specific item plugged in, the more perfect your reading is, as it averages the device's fluctuations over day and night.HIGHLY recommended.

It's a bit thin and shrill -- it sounds like some compression has been added. I suspect that some data is being stripped out to accommodate Bluetooth's limited bandwidth.

These fit a 3.5 mm jack, NOT the old 2.5 mm that you would find in most other/older phones.  Easy way to test if you're not sure, take an iPod headset (or any headset you use for a mp3 or CD player), and see if it fits.  If it does, than you are looking at the right headset.Before getting into too much detail let me first give a concise Pro/Con summation:Pro:Best earbuds on any headphones I've ever used.Con:The microphone is as equally bad as the earbuds are good.Despite being slightly shocked by just how good the earbuds were, these are of no use to me if the microphone is unusable.The Sennheiser MM50 iP Earbuds / Headset have the most outstanding sound I've ever hear from a headset, but an incredibly BAD microphone.  Also, the Sennheisers were engineered to keep the microphone close to your mouth by placing it at the Y of the headphone split, and making on line short enough to pull the mic close to your mouth.  This is an awful design that should never be repeated.  I found myself constantly having to repeat myself when talking on this headset.I can say though, that with the Sennheiser Earbuds, I could hear details in my music that I never heard before.  A simply amazing sound, with outstanding isolation capabilities.  In a very noisy gym, I could keep my iPhone at a low volume and still hear great detail to my music.In comparison, the Ultimate Ears MetroFi headset keeps the normal, symmetrical Y shape to the earbuds, and places the microphone on one of the lines, close to your mouth.  Having my wife call me on her Chocolate 3 phone, I was at first disappointed. \"Did you forget to bring the headset with you?\" I asked.  Nope, she had them on.Over the years, between the two of us, we've probably used about a dozen different headsets between the two of us, and the MetroFi set was the clear winner when it came to microphone quality.  Funny thing is, to look at them, you wouldn't think it.For earbud quality test, I compared them to my Sony, J2, Metrofi 170vi, and iPod earbuds (all noise isolating except the iPod).  Sound quality places the MetroFi 170vi down by the iPod headset, and sadly, they were probably equal to the iPod headset for noise isolation as well.  The Sony and J2 earbuds were roughly equal in both categories, far behind the Sennheiser, and slightly less far ahead of the MetroFi 170vi and iPod set.Comfort wise, I would rate the four as follows: Sennheiser (again, by far), MetroFi 170vi, Sony, then J2 (So bad, they caused one of my ears to be sore for days)Durability could probably be a little better, but they haven't failed me yet.  So far, just one of the 1 1/2 inch sleaves, attached to the earbuds has come off.I would recommend the Metrofi 170vi set over these.  IMHO, when wearing headphones that are also a headset, microphone quality trumps headset quality.edit 11/28/2010I earbud died shortly after this review. It kills me, 'cause for comfort and sound quality, nothing beats these... nothing even comes close to these. Unfortunately, a crappy mic, and poor durability make this a lousy product.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Incredible earbuds don't make up for poor microphone", "unixReviewTime": 1253145600, "reviewTime": "09 17, 2009"}

Many reviewers have already mentioned it.I don't have a powermat so I can only review the USB charging results.The USB charging is slow.  The indicator blinks forever without letting you know when it is fully charged.It charged for over 8 hours today and was still blinking.  When I finally picked it up and found it cool, I realize it's not charging anymore. (Initially it began to feel hot in about 1-2 min you start charging it.)  (It gets hot when the ext battery is being charged or when it's charging the iPhone.)Note that when the USB is used to charge the battery, you can charge it without attaching it to the iPhone.  However, when you are charging the external battery, it will not charge the iphone (because that would make it discharge at the same time it's being charged.)  That said, even with the USB plugged in, and the external battery full, the USB doesn't charge the iPhone. (Even though the user manual says it will charge both in sequence, it doesn't.) I am guessing it's only in wireless charging mode.So, after you unplug the USB from the external battery and press the back button, it will begin to charge the iPhone.Once it starts charging the iPHone, the process is just like plugging into an AC source except there's no cable.  It charges quite fast.A full ext battery can allow charging the iPHone about 1.3 times full capacity, if the iPhone is down to about 20%.Physically, the battery has 3 prong/hook latches onto the case.  But I fear the latch will break easily in the event of a drop.I dropped the phone in case, without ext battery, from bed to floor.  The bottom plugged in section almost came off and the top portion of the case slid out of location as well.  The design really is not fall proof.The plugged in port worries me the most.  In a fall, I fear the USB will be broken off and be left inside the charge port or worse yet, damage the port completely render the iPhone useless once you are out of power.Also, is it a good idea to keep the port constantly plugged in?  Wouldn't it cause unnecessary rubbing against the contacts inside and maybe render the contact less sensitive?With the elongated section plugged in, the case becomes longer.  Looks weird at first but I got use to it.When the bottom portion is plugged in, you will have a hard time with most headphone plugs because of the gap it made.  The factory iPhone headphone can still work because of the linear design of the plug.  My other 90\" right angle plug Bose headphone will not work.There are many issues that are not \"user friendly\" with this overall design.It seems the designer is more eager to come up with a wireless charger than a fully integrated user experience.I reserve my recommendations on this product.****add after 2 weeks of useThe protection on this case is terrible.The case was dropped once from bed high and once from kitchen counter height.The first time it fell from the bed, it broke half of the slim piece next to the volume control buttons.When it fell from the kitchen counter to vinyl flooring, the top corners broke off.I have never seen a cover with such weak drop protection.The phone itself withstood much impact without the case.I fear this case won't be in working condition much longer.DO NOT BUY if you need batter refill as much as protection.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Some issues you can't ignore...(added,, after 2 weeks of use)", "unixReviewTime": 1377734400, "reviewTime": "08 29, 2013"}

The case doubles as both protection for your iPhone 4 and as a credit card holder. It holds up to three cards which you can thumb out one by one from the small slot in the back. The cards hold in place thanks to a raised rubber bump inside the slot that keeps them secure. You really can throw your worries about the cards accidentally slipping out aside because like I said, the case does its job and does it very well. I also really like the black and gray mix design and though I was initially put off by the slight bulkiness the case adds to the phone, I feel like it gives the phone a heftier feel that somehow makes it seem sturdier and more comfortable to hold.The problem I have with this phone case is the idea of the whole thing. While it does work, you have to ask yourself if you really want to put a bunch of your most valuable possessions together in one convenient package. I absolutely hate the idea of losing my phone or my credit/ ATM cards but walking around with the cards slotted into the case managed to keep me paranoid for the entire time I had them together. Have you ever misplaced your phone? Of course, we all have. Now picture misplacing your phone along with your ATM card and now you start to see what I mean. And if someone steals your phone, which does happen in this day and age, you're also paying for a shopping spree.I actually like the case enough to recommend it but not enough to use it for card storage. I currently use it to hold my entrance keycard for work and the two together make a perfect fit, better than any retractable string belt loop chain or spring clip could ever be.

Then take away the Commuter's impossible iron-hard buttons and replace them with soft, rubber caps that are very responsive and much, much easier than the Commuter's.

The speck costs 30 bucks. When I did receive the speck, I tried it on and ended up returning it. Compared to this case, the speck made the phone look too bulky.Pros:1. Nice matte finish. Not a fingerprint/lint magnet2. Good grip. Though the Droid Maxx has a rubbery texture of its own, it feels more secure in my hand with the case on rather than without. I think it could be because the glass of the screen reaches the very edges of the device and that makes it less grippy.3. No frills simple design, which I like.4. There are ridges at the edges of the case that give the phone a very slim look. The speck did not have any and it instantly made the phone look super bulky5. Decent protection. The phone has tumbled from my hand onto our hard wood floor about 4 times so far. No harm done.Cons:1. The case was slightly bowing out on one side away from the phone. Very slight but noticeable. After 2 weeks of use, this has significantly reduced and I can barely notice it anymore.2. The cut-outs in the back are not perfectly centered around the mic holes, leaving the mic holes at the edge of the cutout. I need to do more testing to determine if this is affecting calls. I have had people reporting trouble hearing me when I am on speakerphone, but I haven't yet concluded that this is due to the case.3. I wish the bottom lip of the case was deeper so as to come up to the bottom edge of the glass. The sliver of grey between the bottom lip and the glass looks odd. Given the flexibility of the case, I don't think a deeper bottom lip would make the case any more difficult to get onto the phone, as long as you insert the phone in bottom first.4.

{"reviewerID": "AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU", "asin": "B006QLIW84", "reviewerName": "Kaio", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "I've tried several of these cell phone signal boosters over the last couple years, including the zBoost YX300, zBoost YX400 and the Wilson Electronics 801242 MobilePro.  None of them really do all that much, and all of them are grossly overpriced, given the absolute minimal improvement they offer.  With such little bang for the buck, it's hard for me to say it's worth anyone's time, trouble or money to get one of these.  Having said that, if you're in an area that gets terrible cell reception, then you may as well give one of these a try and see if it helps -- just be sure to buy direct from Amazon so you can return it, no questions asked, if you're not happy with the results.Ridiculously Short Antenna CableIs coax cable really that expensive by the foot wholesale?  Because given how many manufacturers scrimp with short cables, you'd think it's more precious than gold.  It's just stupid, plain and simple.  The instructions for virtually all boosters like this are emphatic about keeping the antenna as far away from the base unit as possible, yet, they give nowhere near enough cable length to accomplish that requirement.  This is especially ridiculous for car boosters, since, given the cable length, the only option is to run the antenna out the nearest window and stick it to the roof of the car.  Clearly they're hoping everyone who wants to do a decent clean install will come running back for pricey extension cables -- the slight of hand couldn't be more obvious; it's blatant nickel & dime price gouging.Does It Really Boost Signal Strength?Eh... sort of.  My cell phone basically gains 1 bar of signal strength no matter which of these signal boosters I use -- hardly enough to justify the steep cost.  In fact, if you're not militant about the antenna placement, these boosters often don't work at all, and can cause a feedback loop -- It's happened to me many a time where the caller and I were hearing an echo delay, which magically disappeared once the booster was turned off.  So yes, these can help -- sometimes, maybe -- but they can just as easily become the root of your signal problem too.Nice Phone CradleI do like the design of the phone cradle itself.  The side grips are adjustable up and down, as well as with adjustable width to fit any phone.  My phone is held firmly in place without any concern over being too tight to cause any damage, or making it difficult take the phone in and out.  However, I could also see my phone easily flying across the car if I had to slam on the brakes; it could easily pop out of this holder by accident, no problem.Gooseneck Power AdapterThis one is going to be 'love it or hate it' depending on how your car is laid out.  For me, the cigarette lighter/power adapter is in a spot that makes using this gooseneck mount inconvenient, because it places the phone directly in the way of the gear shift.  Also, the part that inserts into the car's accessory slot is such a tight fit, that I was afraid of damaging the car when trying to remove this goose mount. It was VERY difficult to get out and back in again multiple times while trying to adjust the fit.  If I decide to keep using this, I'll probably opt for mounting it directly to the dash somehow and just toss out the gooseneck.Alternate Power OptionsThis booster can alternatively be powered by a standard USB/micro cord that can be plugged into a standard cigarette/accessory adapter.  One saving grace is this holder DOES have a charging port to charge your cell phone.  Now that's a nice touch.Bottom Line - If you're getting terrible cell reception, then you may as well give one of these boosters a try.  In my opinion, it doesn't matter which one you get, because they're all solidly mediocre and overpriced.  Just be sure to buy from Amazon, or somewhere that has an equally good return policy, just in case.

But I shouldn't have been.Positives:1 - It is smaller than I expected, and lighter. It's like the length of two dice stacked on each other.2 - It feels nice and looks nice. I have a full beard, and my wife says it almost blends in. Now I don't have a blue beard, but I guess in lower light it is all just dark. :)3 - Their Web site and software works flawlessly. It was easy to just plug in and update. I am on a Mac, and it installed smoothly and just works. I was happy to see that you can change the press and hold to launch Siri. I did that, and it works great.4 - Wife called while I was in the car, and she said she could hear me quite well, certainly better than my stereo's built-in mic.5 - That brings me to the delight. I was worried about how this would do in my car, because I have a BT radio (Sony MEX-BT3900U). I want to stream my music/books to my stereo, but use the earpiece to handle calls. So as I mentioned, I was in the car listening to my Audible audiobook, and my wife called. It paused the book (as usual), showed caller info on my radio (as usual) and also told me about the call in my ear. I pressed the button on the headset to answer, it answered it on my earpiece. I got done with the call, and pressed play to resume on my radio, and it started streaming back over it. Seamless! Also, on the way home, I got out of the car, and it paused the book (as usual), but I pressed play, and it resumed on my earpiece.6 - I am able to pair it both with my iPad mini and my iPhone; it works great with both to stream audio.7 - No problems with my beard obscuring my voice, it seems. Still, the real test will be when I have the top down; too cold for that right now..8 - I got it at least partly so I could have an easy and convenient way to listen to audio on my devices while, e.g., watching a show on TV or lying in bed, without disturbing those around me. It works well for that.9 - Stays on decently even without ear loop, probably not for jogging, though.Some drawbacks:1 - As far as I can tell, it doesn't support pause/play for media; inconvenient when your phone is in your pocket.2 - Volume control is a bit odd--press and hold and wait while it cycles. There is enough room they could have made it a rocker and click, similar to the Apple earbud controllers.3 - Sound quality isn't awesome, but it is sufficient.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleasantly Surprised", "unixReviewTime": 1357603200, "reviewTime": "01 8, 2013"}

Both are very slim and lightweight cases that look great on my iPhone 5S.The cases are easy to snap on, and relatively easy to take off, but not so easy that they end up coming off unintentionally. The cutouts for all the ports and buttons are generous that you won&#8217;t find any issues with bigger cables or headphones. It is also very easy to access the volume buttons, mute switch, and sleep/wake button.I personally prefer the smoke color because it adds a little bit of a tint to the iPhone, but the clear color is great because it shows off the color of your iPhone the best. I have the space gray color, and it looks great in either case.In testing, I tested the shock absorbing and scratch resistant capabilities of both cases. Dropping the phone from a normal height to a hard floor resulted in no injuries to the phone, as long as it didn&#8217;t fall on its face. There is a slight &#8220;lip&#8221; around the front of the case that ensures the screen does not touch the surface when it is placed face down. Both the cases protect the phone well, and importantly, they do not show scratches on the case even after intentionally running keys over the back. I also like that it keeps out a decent amount of dirt, which cannot be said about other cases.Overall, both are excellent cases that protect your phone while still keeping it relatively slim.

{"reviewerID": "AFR9GYKAHM37U", "asin": "B00DVRIUN8", "reviewerName": "J. Ciriello \"AdWhois\"", "helpful": [120, 134], "reviewText": "First off, let me say. This phone is amazing. It's lightning quick, never hangs on any tasks and consistently gets the best benchmark when I test it on any of the benchmarking apps available on the marketplace. Oh yea, and the camera is otherworldly, I will never need to bring my point and shoot camera with me again...Now, let's get to the review.I picked this phone up for $299 at an AT&T; store after Amazon had problems processing my order. Almost as soon as I walked out the door I had regrets (let me explain). Windows Phone 8 is amazing, it's so smooth, capable and polished; it really is the best mobile OS, that being said. If you've had a Windows Phone 7.8+ device before then WP8 on the Lumia 1020 just feels stale, not unlike any other OS at this point, the difference between the 1020 and the other devices is the price tag. $299 is just too expensive for me to recommend this phone to people who already have a high-end WP 7.8 or WP 8 device, aside from the camera there really is nothing different...Windows Phone 8 PerformanceAll that being said, if you don't currently have a WP 7.8 or WP 8 device, by all means go for the 1020, it's a wonderful device and Windows Phone 8 will make you smile at every turn, the Lumia 1020 has a whopping 2GB of ram, easily 4 times more than the ultra-efficient Windows Phone 8 needs to operate, this means that there really isn't any task the 1020 can't handle, and background tasks won't weigh you down. Like the 920, 928, and 925, the Lumia 1020 has a 1500mhz Dual Core processor which is more than enough to run Windows Phone 8, you won't get the satisfaction of saying \"I've got a quad-core\" like some of the android phone owners, but when they go head to head I have no doubt in my mind the 1020 will be faster than any android device you pit it against. The beauty lies in the software; Windows Phone is slim and professional, while most Android offerings are bloated and laggy...Build QualityThe build construction of my Lumia 1020 is exactly what you'd expect from a high-end Nokia device, top of the line, solid construction. Although my 1020 will wear a protective case for its entire life I have little doubt that this phone could withstand a few unprotected drops and suffer only a few scratches on the case, Gorilla Glass 3 gives you that added piece of mind that your screen isn't going to crack after one drop.Pictures/Videos\"Second to none\" is the phrase I would use to describe the Lumia 1020's camera. Nothing else even comes close (including my Sony Cyber shot), night time pictures without a flash, though still worse than what your eyes can see (obviously) are the best I've seen on any phone, or point-and-shoot camera. If you somehow have a tripod for this phone you can have it leave the shutter open for up to 4 seconds, giving you extremely bright night time pictures (and blurry if your subject is moving). The delayed shutter function does allow you to set the phone down after telling it to take a picture so you can minimize movement while taking a night time picture.Video on the Lumia 1020 is spectacular as well, smooth HD capture and clear audio recording are high points of any phone, and like the 928, the Lumia 1020 dons multiple microphones to make audio recording in hectic environments possible.On top of the physical pleasantries of the 1020's camera, there are a plethora of apps that make use of the camera. My favorites so far are Photosynth (lets you capture a spherical image around you) and Fresh Paint (think \"Take on Me\"). Instagram or not, there is certainly no shortage of cool apps you can use with the 1020's awesome camera.Storage SpaceLike the other unibody Lumias before it, the 1020 has no way of accessing its battery compartment, and no way of adding a micro SD card. What you see is what you get (actually it's about 5GB less than what you see); with no apps installed the Lumia 1020 will have a maximum of 27 GB of free space. 3 GB lost to formatting, 2 GB lost to the OS. In a battle of fortune, the 1020s full res pictures are almost 10MB a piece, that's great because you really are getting full quality pictures but not so great because you will eat into that chunk of free space alarmingly quickly if you take a moderate amount of pictures. When you add apps, music, and videos into the mix, that free space gets even smaller. To combat this, AT&T; is offering a free upgrade to their 50gb of cloud storage through AT&T; locker (limited time offer they say), and as always SkyDrive offers 7gb of free cloud storage (I'm still on the 25gb free they gave me for being an early WP user). Even with those two free cloud storage options I long for expandable memory. If I could, I would throw in a 64 GB MicroSD and carry around tons of music and videos. Cloud storage, is not the answer to phone storage in my opinion...Battery LifeA key question people seem to ask me all the time is what kind of battery life they should expect. The Lumia 1020 is on par with any other modern smart phone out there. It has a large 2000mAh battery and lasts me an entire day using it for email, web browsing, the occasional game and of course picture taking. If you do data heavy tasks or talk on the phone a lot you can expect your phone (any phone) to run out of juice much faster. Comparing the battery life of my 1020 to my 900, I'll say that my 1.5 year old 900 still gets better battery life than the 1020, but I hear that Xenon flashes use a lot of juice.PriceLike I said, the Lumia 1020 is expensive, currently ranging from $266 on Amazon to $299 at the AT&T; store. The Microsoft Store also sells the Lumia 1020 for $299 but includes the camera grip free of charge. I mean, sure it's a free grip, but I can't see anyone using it on a daily basis or ever taking it with them, it's huge...The only way I have been able to justify spending $299 on the Lumia 1020 coming off the Lumia 900 is by realizing that this will replace my point-and-shoot camera, so if you think of it as paying $150 for a good camera and $150 for a great phone it feels a little better.IssuesI have to disclose the fact that I am on my second Lumia 1020. The first handset I got was plagued with a few issues. The phone had reception issues and would drop calls when I was standing still in places my Lumia 900 had full LTE coverage and call quality was genuinely poor, on top of the signal problems that first 1020 had issues where Bluetooth would disconnect every 5 minutes or so. My phone says it has the Amber update which is supposed to mean BT 4.0, so I originally chalked the BT problems up to that, but my new handset has none of these problems (and does have the Amber update). AT&T; swapped out both the handset and my SIM card to cover all the bases on the reception issues. My new handset has yet to drop a call and seems to get a much more solid connection; call quality is still nothing ground-breaking however.There are a couple minor issues that both my handsets share.The first issue is that when looking at the phone in a completely dark room with brightness on auto, I noticed what appear to be streaks or irregularities in the black back ground of the screen. Both 1020 handsets had this problem and although you can't see them with any external light on, or the brightness turned up, it makes me wonder what those irregularities are, and if they will be a problem further down the road.The other issue that both handsets I've had share, is that the loud speaker on the phone is quiet, disappointingly quiet. There is really no comparison between the 1020 and the Lumia 900 when it comes to loudness of the speaker, the 900 takes the cake...ConclusionThe Nokia Lumia 1020 is a great phone, easily worth 5 stars. If you don't currently have a Windows Phone 8 or 7.8 device and you want to take amazing pictures, by all means go out and get this phone. It will be 100% worth its expensive price tag. However; if you do have a Windows Phone 8 or 7.8 Lumia I would seriously think about how much you value picture/video taking. Aside from the camera the only measurable difference between this device and even my Lumia 900 are the few WP8 exclusive apps and .2 inches of diagonal screen width. I haven't noticed any real improvement in performance over my 900. If you currently have the Lumia 920, the ONLY differences between it and the 1020 are the camera, and the fact that the 1020 doesn't have built in wireless charging, it really wouldn't be worth upgrading from the 920 to the 1020 unless you are a true camera nut in my opinion.Perhaps what the Lumia 1020 has shown me most so far, is just how amazing my Lumia 900 was/is; dated camera aside, that 900 can still go toe to toe with the 920 or 1020 on most tasks with ease. In addition to the best cellphone camera ever, the 1020 does offer something the Lumia 900 never will, future proofing.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great phone but Im not so sure it's worth the hefty price tag", "unixReviewTime": 1376006400, "reviewTime": "08 9, 2013"}

{"reviewerID": "A1YEPFLLH42OU1", "asin": "B00DOMKBJG", "reviewerName": "Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"", "helpful": [38, 41], "reviewText": "I bought two of these on sale, the 16,800 and 8,400 mAh models.I also have a RavPower element 10,400 mAh, Anker Astro E5 15,000 mAh, and Anker 2nd Gen Astro 2 9000 mAh, plus a bunch of smaller capacity battery packs like the K3 flash 3,000 mAh and Solar Restore 1,500 mAh. My wife thinks I'm obsessed with these things for some reason; can't imagine why.Straight up, I'll be forthright- there is no way I'd pay MSRP for these batteries. They're about double the price of Anker's, and not appreciably better for the capacity. This is why no matter how much I like them, I just can't give them full marks- they're just prohibitively expensive at the current going rate here ($120 and $70 for the 16.8k and 8.4k respectively, as of this writing). If you had to choose between one of these and two Anker packs of nearly identical capacity, I'd say you would have to be some fool to go with the Gorilla Gadgets no matter how nicely packaged they are.That having been said, these are very nice battery packs. They have a smooth, slightly rubberized texture finish and well thought-out design. The power buttons are recessed, so you won't accidentally push them if you store them in a bag. The larger of the two (16,800 mAh) has a backlit digital charge display showing % remaining/charged, and they both have LED lights (8,400 mAh has a dual LED, 16,800 a single). Both have a 5v/2 amp output and 5v/1 amp output that can charge simultaneously. They come with a cable with an interchangeable lightning and 30-pin Apple connector, which makes these useful for Apple devices if you don't want to carry the OEM cable with you. They both seem to be very efficient, on par with the 2nd gen Anker Astros and a good deal above some of the el-cheapo packs out there.I do happen to own the two closest Anker counterparts to these two models, so it's worth comparing them for prospective buyers:Anker Astro 2 (2nd gen) vs. Gorilla Gadgets Uhuru! 8,400 mAh:---Anker---Input: 5v 1.2AOutput: 5v, 2.3A, 5v 1ACapacity: 9,000 mAhIndicator: 10-stage LEDOther: shake to wakeCables: 1.5 ft USB-microCurrent Amazon list price: $37---Gorilla---Input: 5v 1AOutput: 5v 2A, 5v 1ACapacity: 8,400 mAhIndicator: 4-stage LEDOther: 2-LED lightCables: 1 ft USB-micro/30-pin/lightningCurrent Amazon list price: $70The Anker battery is more narrow, has more tapered sides, but is taller. They have the same depth and about the same general bulk and weight. I like both of these batteries and they're both pretty portable and handy. The Gorilla with its lights can be useful if you carry it around in the dark, but the Anker fits a lot better in pocket since it's less square. I'd say either of these is about the biggest pack you can comfortably carry with you in a pants pocket.Anker Astro E5 vs. Gorilla Gadgets Uhuru! 16,800 mAh:---Anker---Input: 5v 1.5AOutput: 5v, 2A, 5v 1ACapacity: 15,000 mAhIndicator: 4-stage LEDOther: LED lightCables: 1.5 ft USB-microCurrent Amazon list price: $50---Gorilla---Input: 5v 1AOutput: 5v 2A, 5v 1ACapacity: 16,800 mAhIndicator: blue backlit digital displayOther: LED lightCables: 1 ft USB-micro/30-pin/lightningCurrent Amazon list price: $120The Anker battery in this case is considerably smaller- about an inch shorter but about the same width and depth. This is probably due to the lack of a digital display, which is certainly a nice feature on the Gorilla. The Uhuru's display also shows which ports are active. It stays backlit for a few seconds when the power button is pressed, and at other times the display remains on but not lit. I imagine this doesn't use much power since it's just a LCD, and the tendency to accidentally press the Anker's large button probably gives it at least as much drain. They are still roughly the same weight despite the disparity in bulk, and neither of these two is comfortably pocketable. These are good if you're going off-grid for a few days, but other than that I'd say their utility is a bit limited on account of their sheer size and mass. I typically leave them on my bed stand where there's no outlet within reach, in case I need a phone charge overnight.Bottom line: these are very nice battery packs, though I'd say Anker's equivalents are extremely competitive in terms of function. The really big disparity is cost, but that is of course very subject to change. In case anyone's wondering, I got these Gorilla Gadgets batteries off Woot for $40 and $25 respectively, which is actually less than the Ankers. At that price, I'd without hesitation recommend these batteries over the competition, but not for what they're going for here.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Powerful, if expensive external battery packs", "unixReviewTime": 1386028800, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2013"}

I had been eyeing it since I heard about it on a tech show. I finally decided to take the leap since my wife and I bought our house a year ago and I can't hear my cell phone ringing when I put it in another room or more commonly, forget to turn the ringer back on after coming home from work. My wife has had to reach me about important, time-sensitive matters numerous times and I checked my phone hours later to find I had missed about 10 calls from her. The device connects to up to 3 different phones at once, but since it is only my wife and I, we only use 2. Each line has a priority, so when dialing out, it will start by trying the phone in slot 1, then 2 and finally 3. If you don't want to dial out through line 1, then you can dial *2 or *3 and then dial normally and the gateway will dial out through the respectively connected phone (all explained in the instructions).  We both use the Blackberry 8330 Curve, which each use Bluetooth version 2.0. We keep our gateway in the bedroom since that is the most convenient place for us and we get a full strength tower signal throughout our house. There is a usefulness of placing it in a room that gets the best tower signal and then connecting your phone line from there (i.e. bedroom 1 gets no signal, but bedroom 2 gets great signal from the cell towers).You can connect your landline handsets to the gateway in 1 of 2 ways. The simplest method is to plug your phone right into the gateway and since most cordless phones come with multiple handsets, it's very easy to then disperse the extra handsets to convenient places throughout the house. The other method of landline connection involves disconnecting your home from the phone company and then plugging the gateway into any phone jack, which then gives all other phone jacks in your house a connection. I haven't been successful in accomplishing this method, but the telephone we have had 3 different handsets, so it was not a big issue. The disconnect process is not explained by the Xlink company (for liability reasons), but if you search for something like VOIP my house, you'll find it. It is the same process.Since we keep our phones in the same room (approx 6-8 feet) from the Xlink gateway, we have no sound quality problems. If we have our cell phones in a different room than the gateway however, there will be crackling & distortion until we put our cell phones closer to the gateway.One of the great features of this device is it allows my wife and I to be on the same cell phone line at the same time if we need to speak to the same person at the same time.There are a few quirks I've found, but don't really bother me and I still give it a 5 star rating.1. When your cell phone is out of range of the gateway, the corresponding light/button on top will blink until it is back in range. (You can click the light/button and it will shut off, but that means it will not reconnect when the phone is back in range, unless you click it again)2. While you can use a built in address book feature to dial out on land line handsets, it will only work on the first cell phone connected, so consider which phone should be connected in slot 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. Phone 1 can dial out using built in address book, but phone 2 can't dial out using the built in address book when phone 1 is in range, you have to dial *2 then the phone number (manually) to dial out when phone 1 is connected).3. The light buttons on top are a fairly bright blue. That may bother some people, but not us.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great device.

The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90% of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model.  I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels, but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around.  It's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone, you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack. That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug. Calling this \"Universal\" is a little bit of an overstatement, but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone.  Unfortunately, a specific compatibility list is hard to come by. Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine.  For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling, I recommend you try the version with \"Noise Cancelling.\"  It's about $7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm. For those who don't like the microphone arm, the Jabra EarWave Bud doesn't have a microphone arm, but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt. Personally I don't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models.  The differences are mainly in comfort, style, and ease of use.  This product is decently priced, but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding, like I am, and are willing to spend the money.  This is a pretty good model though, definitely enough to satisfy most users.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good middle of the road earpiece from Jabra.

I've put my thoughts below on different criteria for this case.Fit: It fits very securely around the nexus 5 and shows no signs of give once put on securely. It consists of two pieces - a main rubber back that covers most of the device and a 2nd more rigid (but still flexible) outer &#34;ring&#34; to hold the case tightly to the body of the phone itself. I think this system works well, and inspires confidence with a snug secure fit. The only thing that isn't quite so snug are the buttons on either side, with a little bit of looseness on the volume-rocker buttons of the case. Not a deal-breaker, and certainly hasn't at all impacted usability.Protection: It offers very good protection from drops and just every-day usage. I would say that if I dropped this onto a hardwood floor or just outside on the ground - so long as it landed on part of the case I'd expect the phone to be unharmed. The problem is if you drop the phone and it lands on the screen - there's pretty much minimal protection there. The case does offer protection when you place the phone screen facing down on a flat surface by raising the screen up a little. But beyond that you have no real protection. Conveniently, spigen sells glass screen protectors for exactly that reason which should work very nicely. I plan to buy one soon actually.Finish: I just think this is a very classy looking case - and certainly far better looking than the rubber nexus one that google is trying to sell directly through their store as the official case. It just feels like a quality product, and certainly worth the $20 asking price that I bought this at. The one downside is that the backside of the case and just along the edges - its a bit slippery. The Nexus 5 phone comes with a nice soft-touch rubbery finish that feels easy to grip. You definitely don't get any of that with this case. So while the case itself looks and feels nice on its own, it does make the phone a bit harder to get a firm secure grip on for me at least.Verdict: I think this is still the case to beat right now for the Nexus 5. If you too are worried/had a bad experience with dropping your phone or just want something that looks nice and will keep your phone feeling new - the spigen neo hybrid case is one I'd highly recommend. It does have some short-comings, but overall it's still a great case and out of the ones I've seen being sold on amazon is the best one to go with. You have to decide how much protection you want and what size you're willing to go with, but I think the spigen is a great balance of protection and good looks.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Currently the nicest looking and frankly best Nexus 5 case IMO", "unixReviewTime": 1383782400, "reviewTime": "11 7, 2013"}

It securely holds the phone in plain view. The locking mechanism for the phone is very nice and feels well made.The only difficulty I had was that the product would not mount to the center vent in my 2005 Chev Suburban. The vent louvers were too deep. So I had to put it on the left passenger vent. It's just a little bit further away than I would like. Also, my Samsung Galaxy S3 is a little heavy, so it was swinging when I took corners. However, this was easily corrected by wedging an o-ring into the vent gap. The o-ring provides enough resistance to movement, while still allowing the phone to be positioned as desired.I'm very happy with this mount and highly recommend it for road warriors. In fact, it is really nice when paired with the Motorola HX550 bluetooth earpiece and the corresponding MotoSpeak app. With this setup, you can make voice calls and texts without having to touch the phone.

Typically \"ruggedized\" items add a significant amount of bulk, and while this unit is slightly beefier than the NT120C, it's not excessively large, and that was a pleasant surprise.- The button and indicator lights, while not obvious at first glance, are well-placed and clear.- The door hatch seems to close solidly and make a good seal, although I question how the closure snap will wear over time.  It seems like the kind of thing that could wear down and allow the door to flop open after an extended number of open/close cycles.- I like the included strap and carabiner.  I don't see myself wearing a battery pack attached to me very often, but I can see how a hiker or outdoor enthusiast could make good use of that capability.  I'd be more likely to use the carabiner to hang the unit from a nail on construction, just to keep it safe and out of harm's way.  I really wouldn't want to drop-test the unit unnecessarily.- The compass was relatively accurate.  At first I thought it was off based on my sense of the local geography at my office, but I compared it to another compass that I trust and it was pretty accurate.  I guess my brain was the faulty part!- Of course, as the main purpose of the unit, the NT120R charges devices as expected.  The power button is a little small, and I had to check the screen of the device I was charging to make sure that I had pressed it correctly, but everything worked well.  Capacity and charge times were accurate for the devices I was using.  A 12000mAh battery is a lot of juice, so it had no trouble topping off several devices, more than once on a single charge.- I did not perform any drop testing, but toting around on a construction site, the device got bumped around and still worked as expected.- The Amazon listing shows it to be water-resistant, while the packaging says that the unit is waterproof.  I was very surprised that the back of the box said that the unit is in fact submersible.  I'm a little skeptical that the rubber gasket attached to the door would completely keep water out of the USB ports.  I did not throw the unit in to the pool to test it, but I'm confident that it'll certainly keep out rain, drink spills, and other random moisture.  I'll have to take New Trent's word for it that I can take it swimming.- Overall it's a really tough little product that works well and should provide an excellent portable power solution for those who work or play in any kind of harsh environment.

Max range with clear line of sight is about 6 feet, but usually less then 24 inches.  It is barely usable if the phone is on my waist in its holster.  Major disappointment.  My Jabra BT250 is better with the Treo, but not hugely so.My biggest problem with this headset is that people are constantly telling me that they can't hear me.  I have to lift the mic boom away from my cheek and then they will say \"Ah! Much better!\".  When that is only the case while I stand there like a dork with one hand holding the mic boom away from my cheek and the other hand holding the phone within a foot of my head.  This looks pretty silly walking down an airport terminal, and rather defeats the purpose of having a headset in the first place...I'll say this, though - the H700 performs the feature that I was looking for which was so bad with the Jabra BT250 - it actually stays on my ear.  I have small ear lobes, and the Jabra won't stay put - if I lean down it falls off.  The H700 stays on very well, and you hardly notice it is even there.  Very comfortable!Too bad the mic gets blocked by my cheek, which makes it worthless about 50% of the time.**Update 5/11/2006**- solution to muffled sound problem...I trimmed a tiny piece of adhesive-backed felt (the kind you put under bowls/vases, etc. you will have on your coffee table)and placed it on the little gray bump on the boom, just behind the tiny mic opening. This creates an air gap between the mic opening and your cheek - problem solved!A great headset with pretty good reception and wonderful form factor. 5 stars if they fix the mic hole clearance problem!", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Nice small package, good features, less than perfect performance", "unixReviewTime": 1143158400, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2006"}

I know my way around tools and small electronics decent enough that I felt just confident enough to tackle this project, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. The glass we received was protected well enough and it had a film on both sides to keep the dust off and prevent scratches. Upon inspecting removing the film off both sides, it appeared clean and looks just like the OEM glass; the build quality may be another story but I didn't have a brand new OEM glass to compare it with!As for the replacement procedure if you're interested... There's a ton of videos and write ups on this sort of thing on youtube and throughout the web that go into greater detail but I'll give you a quick run down of how it went for me:I set up a well lit work station with a heat gun, gloves, an OLFA blade, a plastic pry tool, a razor blade, and the broken phone of course. I heated the glass up on low heat with the gun until it was hot to the touch. From there I used the OLFA blade to get in between the glass and the casing starting from the top. The heat will soften the adhesive and allow easier removal of the glass but make sure not to apply so much heat that you risk damaging the other components (again, not recommended for the weak hearted). The plastic pry tool was used to apply light leverage on the glass once the OLFA blade lifted it enough to get it in there. You don't want to apply too much leverage or you'll break the glass into smaller pieces. That's pretty much it for the rest of the process. When you get to the bottom, gently remove the touch receptors from the glass and take care to not damage them. Once you're done removing the glass pieces (be careful with the smaller ones to not scratch/damage the digitizer below it!), you'll have a bunch of residue on the screen part of the phone to remove, this stuff comes off just by rubbing it with your finger no need to use harsh chemicals or rough motions to take it off. I kept the adhesive on the top and bottom and replaced the adhesive on the sides with some off of a 3M roll I bought on Amazon at the same time. When the digitizer is cleaned, head the adhesive back up with the gun and apply the glass. That's was it. We booted up the phone and opened up a sketch program to draw around the screen and tested taps and gestures as well. Everything was working on the phone was as good as new. Again, look for the other tutorials online for greater detail, I just thought I'd provide a brief rundown on what to expect if you're trying to do this yourself.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "It works", "unixReviewTime": 1366761600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2013"}

It's a battery hog, so having a portable recharge would be great.I opened the box, and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking.Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge, as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects, so I went online and watched the how-to, just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly.I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours, TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete, the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me.I decided based on the specs, 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device, and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes, it dropped to 3, then after 10 minutes it went to 2...At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price, or not put out a product, but hey, whatever.BOTTOM  LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one, but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer, I'm planning on returning for a refund.  I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0, which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price, I'll have to suck it up and pay for it, but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support, that's the cost of it. I also learned that Amazon doesn't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices, so they said their hands are tied.

It appears to be well designed overall and made of quality plastic and rubber.  After playing around with it for a few minutes, I found it easy to attach to my air vent.However, there was one weakness for me that forced me to reduce the rating from 5 to 4 stars:I've added a Laza double power battery to my cell phone.  This battery came with a new phone back to hold the thicker battery.  So overall, my phone (HTC EVO V 4G) case bulges out on the lower back and the phone is maybe 1 to 2 ounces heavier.  This gives me 3500mah power.The problem with this mount for me is that the bottom fold out support legs on this device (that the phone rests on) are not designed for the bigger phone back I have now.  They are too short and barely touch the bottom of the case (which the battery company made to round upwards from the bottom (looks slicker than flat, I guess).  But the sliding sides on the holder do (just barely) grip the phone sides adequately.So I added a strip of Velcro to the back of the phone, which now glues it to the support.  The Velcro plus the side support grabbers and the barely touching bottom supports together work functionally to securely hold the phone in place, yet allow me to remove the phone.

Not only that, but with up to 6 devices when we travel, a high capacity external battery is necessary.This is an 10000mAh battery, the highest I've used to date. Note however that Julian from Maxboost says in one of the comments that all high quality battery chargers have a 30% energy conversion loss and the net power available is 7000mAh, which is in line with my experience.The charger itself is quite compact for its power and very well designed. It's mono-colored with an LCD readout showing the power left/used in percentages. This is great because most batteries only have lights or colors to show usage but this is more precise. There are two outputs, a 2.1A for larger devices and 1.0A for smaller ones (such as phones).The battery works as well as expected. We've used this to charge iPads, iPods, e-readers and all different kinds of phones and have no problems. Using it to recharge 3 phones during a day out, we weren't able to exhaust the charger so we're very pleased with that. But using it to recharge an iPad will use up most of its charge. Still, I would expect this charger to be able to charge an iPad and one phone several times from one whole charge.The battery also comes with a small LED light, activated by pressing the button twice. It's not very strong and some of the light leaks out through one of the USB ports!One of the best things I like about this charger is that the charging cable comes with inter-changeable heads. It has the mini USB, micro USB and Apple iPod head so you can charge devices need those heads. The carrying pouch is another nice inclusion to prevent the battery from getting scratched.Bottom line, this is a high capacity battery charger at a very decent price. On long day trips or traveling, I would recommend the highest capacity charger possible and this would be a good choice.Note: Sample was provided for review.

It should be no brainer. Connect the device to the wall and charge either at 5V2A or at 5V1A. For those who aren't technically inclined, you'll want to make sure your USB AC Wall Charge have at least a 5V2A USB port available for either faster charging speeds or high wattage demands for certain tablets to charge. 5V1A port can charge any smartphone, but for tablets it'll just power it but not charge it from my experience.That information in hand, the first thing you need to know about this USB AC Wall charger is that it has two outputs. The top output is 5V/1A (can charge anything except tablets with 10W demands). The bottom output is 5V/2A (Charge tablets with 10W demands and anything else a bit faster). When I refer to the top and bottom ports, this is with wording right-side up, so you can read them properly. The charger basically splits the 10 Watts delivered from the outlet. So in a nutshell, expect reduced charging speeds with two devices connected to the charger.As for which device it can charge...as long as your device can be charged with a USB cable and doesn't require a separate power adapter, it'll work. The Samsung Galaxy tablets may require a separate USB adapter to get it charging. I do agree with many other reviewers, they should have been more clearer about which ports has which amperage. But since the unit is compact and doesn't cover 2 outlets, it's a keeper. This unit works as advertise. I'll post any future comments if this device malfunctions or breaks down.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Functional USB AC Wall Charger!", "unixReviewTime": 1381795200, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2013"}

OXA has tried to pack a bit more into this battery pack by offering up a TF reader, something I&#8217;ve only seen in one other battery pack. A bit extraneous for most people, but it does work and is a nice bonus.There are three USB connectors included with the package, including a Lightning connector. I couldn&#8217;t get the 30-pin connector to work with my first generation iPad. Admittedly, it&#8217;s fickle, but if it doesn&#8217;t work, there&#8217;s no port for using your own cables. The Lightning connector immediately connected and worked on boosting my iPad Air&#8217;s charge.Speaking of iPads, if you are looking at this small capacity OXA, you may wish to take a pass and head on up to something with at least 10000mAh. For example, some of the iPads can be power hogs and the iPad Air has a capacity of 8820mAh. If you&#8217;re looking at the OXA for your iPhone, you&#8217;ll do well and get a full charge. The battery capacity of the iPhone 5 is 1440mAH. That will give you a good idea as to the capacity of this pack.Another nice extra is the lanyard, a convenient one if you are an on-the-go person. There are three blue LED lights to indicate charge, a built-in 5-pin micro B USB cable (I like this), and a small flashlight. The flashlight won&#8217;t light up a room, but will get you where you are going in the dark.FEATURES:&#9658; Designed with advanced and intelligent microchips to ensure safe operation, over 500 recharge cycles test&#9658; Integrated battery capacity status LEDs provide a visual indication of the battery life&#9658; Includes a high intensity flashlight and 1 micro USB cable(5V/1A output)&#9658; Stylish brushed metal anti-slip surface ensures light weight, scratch resistance and durability&#9658; Built-In SD Card Slot could be used as a portable card reader for your convenientSPECS:~&#9658; Size: 90*26.7*24mm~&#9658; Capacity: 2200mAh~&#9658; Output: 5V =1A~&#9658; Input: 5V=1A~&#9658; Working temperature: -5 ~ 50C~&#9658; Support: iPhone, Mobile, PSP, iPadSample provided for review.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sleek small capacity battery pack with a Lightning connector that works with my iPad Air ...", "unixReviewTime": 1404950400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2014"}

The iPad and most tablets require a least 2.1 amps and 10 watts to charge at a decent rate.

I opened the box, put the battery in, my sim card and SD card and it worked.Over the past couple days I have made a list of the pros and cons.Pro:It has a real cool screen with awesome color that swivels open and made everyone at work say Ooooo!Cons:* I think there are more buttons than you need, many are repetitious, but they look impressive. Most of the functions take several steps. I work with computers and accessories all day, I am not intimidated by something different. But this was not a well thought out design.* A tiny button on the top opens the camera. It's a very tiny black button, flat to the surface and the same color as the phone so its hard to find and difficult to push, I used my fingernail when I found it. You can take both photos and video. I somehow got the camera into video mode and it took a while to get it back to photo. The picture it took was good quality.* There are no one step calls as with other phones. There are several ways to make a call which I won't go through, but it is neither easy nor convenient. The swivel screen is in the way when making a phone call. The basic function of a cell phone should be making calls quick and easy. The Sidekick gets an \"F\" for that. And the same grade for reception. My last phone, a very basic and inexpensive phone, gets reception in places this one can't receive or make a call, like in my house.* I don't think this phone should be categorized under slider, I have a slider and closing it is a simple one hand move. This doesn't slide, it swivels.* With all the functions they have available, there is only one alarm.* I had TMobile turn on data so I could download features I need like another alarm, but The phone was never able to access the Internet so I cancelled that service.* It makes loud annoying sounds for whatever you do, opening the screen, keystrokes and just about everything. So I adjusted the settings to silent and turned the ring volume up, a multi step process through the menu. When I am at work I turn the volume down, then later when I turn the volume up, it resets all the sounds back on.* Texting is not easy to access, another multi step process. Getting texts is in a whole different location than writing a new text.* There are many buttons, and some just duplicate what others do. It looks impressive, but that's all.* The screen and buttons are not customizable so there is no way to set up one step shortcuts for features you use often.Everything that other phones do with a simple one or two steps, this phone requires attention to what you are doing and has multiple steps many starting from the menu. Doing almost anything with this phone is like carrying your PC around, and trying to get into programs without shortcuts on the desktop.This is not a phone you can hand to a friend and tell them, here, use my phone. You either have to dial for them, or hand them the users manual.

First the battery is ridiculously large but i could deal with that because the battery lasted a long time compared to the standard, I even let it charge for overnight like some ppl said to avoid issues.Cons: The door was almost impossible to get on because it didn't quite fit so had to force it with alot of pressure.  It literally reboots several times a day which at first I was ok with because if you were careful picking it up or sitting it down it wouldn't reboot.  Now after 3 months it reboots 5 or more times every single day and I just cant take it anymore.  It reboots because the battery doesn't fit snugly and the door doesn't help in that department so then the connectors between the phone and the battery loses connection if their is any movement.  Because the battery is not a snug fit the connectors can disconnect at anytime and the phone will not turn back on, you have to open the door then push it back in with extreme force then the phone will turn back on.  I don't recommend this phone unless you don't mind it turning off when you put it in your pocket or purse or case or even when you take it out.  I'll be in the middle of a call and it just turns off, extremely annoying.

I remember some years back when people with cell phones would walk around with these little devices in their ears. Today, that is less common. Wired headsets have become more the standard for walking and running while using a smart-phone and, like many others, I prefer to use a Bluetooth speaker-phone in the car rather than having something stuck in my ear. Non-the-less, there is still a place and a need for Bluetooth earpieces like this one.It paired easily with my iPhone5. I found the reception volume a bit soft for my liking and hearing, but it was audible. People on the other end said I sounded pretty much the same as I do using a speaker-phone. (NOTHING sounds as good as holding the phone to the side of your head!)The unit is quite small and unintrusuve. I did not need the over-the-ear plastic hook, but simply attached the smaller of the two available covers, and inserted it into my ear where it stayed firmly until I took it out. The controls are minimal and work as advertised. I especially liked the fact that this E200 charges with a standard USB-MiniUSB charging cable. It also comes with a USB AC adapter, so can be charged from household current or from a USB port on a computer.It reminds me of the old Samsung WEP200 series that were great but do not work well with newer (BT3) devices.

Chang", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "While this headset is unique and quite sleek, I can't say too many positive things about this.  Here are the list of reasons why this headset is terrible:1) Fidelity - The sound quality was on par with a set of Coby earbuds, all mids and no highs or lows.  I had the earpiece properly inserted into my ear, sounds horrible.  Don't understand why some reviewers are saying the sounds are great, it truly lacks bandwidth and frequency response.2) Charging - Looks like the &#34;charger&#34; was an after thought or their attempt at recycling old stock.  You get this whacky, what I guess is a cell phone charger, but only a few pins on the charging are used, so only one &#34;latch&#34; out of two of the connector on the charger-side is used.  The charger looks Mickey-Moused.3) Lack of Volume and Next Track/Previous Track - Ok, no volume control I can deal with, no skip track or previous track?  That renders it unusable.  A while ago, I figured out that making playlists were really a waste of time, so I like to randomize my entire mp3 library on my iphone.  No next track/previous track means I have to whip out the phone.  The default corded iphone earbud with remote allows me to skip to next track, adjust volume without having to whip out my phone.  This feature is what garners this product a two-star.4) Wrong Material Choice?  The rubber on the ear bud fittings are of chalky, &#34;dry&#34; feeling rubber, as such, it will not grip the inside of your ear.  The slightest movement will make the ear bud fittings work itself out of your ear.  I miss my AcoustiBuds by Burton Technology.  They seemed to have gotten this part right, why can't a corporate giant like Sony/Ericsson get a simple material selection?  Did they not test it?  Did they test it on their own moist ear and said &#34;good enough&#34; and called it a day?  This is a piss poor selection of material, these in-ear buds have been around since they started handing out headsets on airplanes some 30 years ago.  With today's wider selection of all sorts of exotic rubbers, they couldn't get this little detail correct?5) The remote (if you can call it that) seriously is in a wrong place.  It's too high up.  I think this length was design for people with shorter necks.  It just wasn't well thought out.6)  Accessories that came with this earbud - the little clip that came with it is a joke, and removing the clip damaged the insulation on the wires.  The protective bag is just a cheap cloth bag you find in gimmicky audio accessories from generic manfacturers.What ever happened to Sony?  This brand has really gone down the drain.  Their TV sets suck, their audio accessories suck, their video game console sucks, everything from this company as of late really sucks.  This company is a joke.

I realized after the 2nd one that i installed, that my entire purchase was defective and came with bad cut outs.  The install was simple, and quite easy (but then again, ive done this many times before)  I would suggest going on ebay and spending .99 cents for protectors if your looking for poor alignment, because i did not get any use at all out of this $7 purchase, due to poor alignment of the cut outs.  I would have sent them back, but have already tried 2 of the 3 i received.  I threw the 3rd one in the trash, once i realized they were all defective.  Total waste of my time and money, and i would not recommend this product to anyone.

A few things you need to note:- If you are using a protective case for your phone (I am using aEvecase Leather Wallet Case with Stand and Credit Card Holder for Samsung Galaxy Note 2) you need to remove your phone before you can clip on this lens.- This is a true fisheye lens that will capture a full 180 degrees. I took a shot of my music room, which normally takes three shots to fully capture and the one shot managed to include all of my amps, drums and instruments.- There is NO magnification. This is a straight through lens with the fisheye effect as the only feature.- Your photos will be framed in what will look like a black mat over a porthole. Sort of like a spy shot, and also ultra cool for some unique views of wide areas.I am concerned that the clip extends over my screen on my phone. There is a soft plastic patch with a slight texture that holds the lens in place and seems to protect the lens from scratching. On the other hand I had to reposition the lens to get to my camera icon on the screen. Since this is a new tool I am sure I will discover convenient workarounds. If so I will be sure to update this review.The package itself is simple: it comes with the lens pre-screwed into the clip, a small cloth bag and a lens cover. The latter is a nice touch. The price is nominal considering the quality of the photos I have taken with this already. In fact, I have been able to shoot some interesting pictures. It's a shame that Amazon has eliminated the customer-supplied image feature because a few pictures are worth thousands of words.For the price you cannot go wrong.

When I'm out and about, I use the mono earpiece that connects instantly, asks me if I want to answer an incoming call, and has a good battery life. When I want to listen to my music, it streams music through a pair of ear buds that fit well, are comfortable, and give excellent sound quality. I was not even aware that there was an Android app for this device until I read some of the other reviews -- which shows how carefully I read directions. I simply took the unit out of the container -- plugged it in to charge it, then turned it on while my HTC EVO was in the pair discovery mode. The unit announced it had paired as a phone device and also that it was ready to stream music.  I turned on the phone's music system and listened to my favorite playlist. Some have complained there's no control in the headset. I don't even know whether that's true or not, as I just take the EVO out of its holster and play what I want to play. When I want to make a call, I press the voice dialer app on the phone. All this seems to me to add up to a user-friendly, simple, and straightforward ability to use my phone to make and receive calls and to listen to some of the 1000 or so songs I've loaded on the EVO with very good quality sound. I don't know what more I would ever use, so I've given this product a rating of four stars. when I'm listening to music, I clip the headset to a collar and tuck the unit into my shirt pocket.  I've been able to use the wireless connection for both phone and music while the phone was charging in another room -- the connection is pretty solid.Why not five stars? Because like other users, apparently, the cover fell off my unit. No abnormal activity and it wasn't in my pocket being jostled by keys or pencils -- it was on my ear, and I didn't notice the cover had fallen until I removed the unit to charge it. I have no idea whether there's a fix, but I've emailed Samsung customer service and will update this review when (if?) I get a response. Fifty bucks isn't a lot of money, so they may not be willing to attach much value to service for this product. We'll see.Amended -- I sent Samsung a photo of the bluetooth unit without the cover. They correctly identified that as damaged product which voids the warranty. What they chose not to read was that the damage occurred due to defects in workmanship. My cover just fell off, as others have noted in these reviews. I did not drop, mishandle, or abuse the product -- I was wearing it on my ear and the cover fell off during normal use. Despite their lovely motto claiming endless service they were not willing to stand behind this bluetooth earpiece. In another review, a user noted she fixed the problem with a drop of super glue. All I wanted was a cover -- I would have gladly furnished the super glue. I'll use this product with the innards showing until a drop of rain or a snowflake kills it, then I'll buy another unit.  The responder to my query thanked me for my continued interest in Samsung -- don't think he sees the big picture.

I really enjoy the S-View Flip Cover on the S4, so it made this one even more appealing.So how did we get on?Well, after a week of living with this setup, it has altered the way I imagine a smartphone should be used. I usually plug in whenever I am near a charging cable, be it in a car, or on the nightstand, or on a dock at my desk at work. But I left it unplugged and tried to just use the phone as I normally would. This generally involves a good bit of texting, checking various social media and RSS feeds, and tethering a tablet and Roku player to view streaming media. During two days of heavy use, I didn't have to plug in until the evening of the second day. During more typical use that represented an average day, the battery ran for 56 hours before needing to be plugged in.It was extraordinary, being able to truly use a wireless device completely free of wires. Truly made me think about how constrained I'd been in using a wireless device that spent so much time connected to a charging cable.That said, I really miss the sleek and slim feel that Samsung achieved with the S4. The large case does produce a large bulge in my pants pocket and makes the device feel substantially heavier. I did like the metal trim around the S-View window, and that the window was recessed a bit from the felt lining under the flip cover. On some other Flip Covers I've tried, bits of debris would get trapped beneath the window and cause scratches. This wasn't the case on this setup.As one would imagine, the glossy back caused fingerprints to become easily visible. A matte finish would look and feel a lot better. Also, the protrusion for the extended battery could have blended in with the phone's aesthetic a little better.Overall, I'm glad to have this case in my arsenal for this phone.

DesElms\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "As someone who's now bought several leather or leather-like horizontal cases around here for both his old Samsung Captivate, and his new Samsung Infuse, here's the straight skinny on this case...It handles the length of the Infuse quite nicely, but it's clearly made for both a slightly wider and thicker phone.  One commenter, here, says the phone \"rattles around\" in the case; I don't know if I'd go that far, but it's definitely for a slightly wider and thicker phone; though the length part is at least closer to being right.  But, bottom line, it's close enough to right in all dimensions that it's just not worth complaining about.  And as I'll explain further down herein, there's actually a good potential use for that extra room!As for the overall quality issues that others talk about, here, yes, it's true, that this case does not compare with one of the thirty dollar ones.  Obviously, those are better.  For example, the Rocketfish brand one I got for my old Samsung Captivate, for which I paid pushing fifty bucks at BestBuy (er... or... wait... maybe the MSRP was fifty, and I paid thirty... ugh... I can't remember now), was superior in just about every way... including, and especially, its cool swivel belt clip, and its lack of the annoying additional belt loops on either side thereof, which this one irritatingly has.But I've got both this case, and that Rocketfish sitting on the table in front of me right now, as I type this, and the truth is that the softness of the inside of both cases is about the same; the magnets are about the same; and even though this case is made of... well... I'm not sure it's actually leather... or, if it is, it's pretty bad leather... anyway, even though this case may not be made of the soft, reasonably high-mid- to high-end leather of which the Rocketfish is made, whatever this case is made of (that's close enough to being leather to make most people happy) is perfectly fine.  This one's leather -- or, again, whatever it is that's close enough to leather to not really matter -- is sturdy, wears well, looks nice, its stitching is good, and, all things considered, it's fine.  One most certainly would not be embarrassed to have it on one's belt.  The negative comments, here, about inordinately bad quality, are simply uncalled for.And even though the belt clip in the center of the back of this one doesn't swivel like the one on the Rocketfish, it's still pretty darned strong.  It's definitely not going anywhere.  I realize that some will thread their belts through both the center clip, and the two safety loops on either side -- just to make sure the case never comes loose -- but believe me, it's not going to come loose.  In fact, I'm even contemplating cutting-off the loops... though they're soft enough that they compress down nicely if all one does is use the center clip, so maybe I don't need to cut them off after all.  I'll decide after I've used it more.All things considered, this is a great case... ESPECIALLY for the money.  Frankly, for what this case costs, it could be made of aluminum foil and Scotch tape and it would almost be worth the money.  But, honestly, I can see some retail stores charging up to $15 or maybe even $20 for this one, and, seriously, they could get away with it... the overall quality would support a price like that in a full retail environment.  I kid you not.  Only if one knew how cheap they are around here would such a price feel even remotely like a \"rip off.\"  The case is at least that good; and I wish others would stop posting things around here which mislead readers into suspecting that this case is cheaply made or not worth owning.This case is the same as about a gazillion other cases sold here on Amazon, in all manner of sizes, and for all manner of prices; which cases have either the little \"x\"-looking metal emblem in the corner of the front cover, or the little anchor-looking emblem, or no emblem at all.  I'm pretty sure they're all made by the same Chinese company, regardless of the brand name they bear, or who sells it.  This particular case is the most common type of them out there... some of which sell for up to $30, even here on Amazon.  So everyone here needs to lighten-up on the quality of this case... especially considering the price.But here's one really important thing:  There are a lot of cases around here (at Amazon) which claim to be for the Infuse, but which, trust me on this, are TOO SMALL.  One that I ordered was even too small for a Samsung Captivate (yet it was labeled as being for the Infuse); and another I got was larger, but still not large enough for the Infuse... in fact, it said, right on its packaging, that it was for the \"Google Nexus One\" or the \"HTC HD2\"... both phones not-insignificantly smaller than the Infuse.  With that second one (the one labeled as being for either the \"Nexus One\" or the \"HTC HD2\"), the length of the Infuse could be forced into the case, but when the cover was closed it pressed the power button.  Oy.I cannnot BEGIN to tell you how much of that sort of thing is going on around here.  Almost no one around here ships the right sized case -- at least not of this case's type -- when it's for really big phones like the Infuse.  Most of the sellers of these things apparently just don't realize how big is the Infuse......so, trust me on this, it's a blessing when one of them gets it even close to right, as the seller of this case pretty much does.In fact, get this:  This case is not only big enough for the Infuse, but it'll even handle an Infuse that's got a thin TPU case on it... such as, for example, the BodyGlove Mirage...[...]...just to name one.  And that Mirage is the one that most AT&T; stores carried for both the Captivate and the Infuse, so it's a GOOD one!  I highly recommend it.  It sold in AT&T; stores for twenty bucks; and I've seen it for the Infuse for as low as $1.23 around here (though I think the ones at THAT price are now sold out).  So good is the Mirage that if one can get one for from $7 to even $15, it's well worth it!That, for me, was actually what I've been looking for.  I've wanted a horizontal case that's big enough for my Infuse when I have the BodyGlove TPU case on it......and, boy, are cases of this case's type which are THAT big ever hard to find around here!  I can't even IMAGINE what's going to happen when Samsung Galaxy Note...[...]...owners go snooping around here for a case like this that's big enough to accommodate a Note with a TPU case on it!  Yikes!I also have a no-name brand shiny black TPU case that's a tad thicker than the BodyGlove, and this horizontal leather case will even accommodate that (though with slightly more drag going into and coming out of the case than with the slightly thinner BodyGlove).So, I have to say, all things considered, that this is a pretty darned nice little case of its type for the Samsung Infuse owner.  It's by no means top of the line, of course; but it's nowhere NEAR bad enough for people to be posting things around here about it like \"you get what you pay for\" and some of the other negativity I've seen posted here.  Sometimes I just shake my head in disbelief at the way some people assess things.  Scarier, yet, though, is that people like that end-up on juries and decide people's fates!  But now I digress.  Sorry.I gave this case five stars not because it can compare with the likes of, for example, that Rocketfish I was talking about; but because for a case of this case's price, versus its quality -- and, alas, the fact that it actually FITS an Infuse -- are you KIDDING me?  Of COURSE it's worth five stars!  Gimmee a break, people!And, oh... by the way... don't bother going out and looking for a Rocketfish for the Infuse.  They don't make one... at least not as of this writing.  Don't worry... I already checked!If you're an Infuse owner, and you have no TPU case on it, then, yes, this case might be a tad (and, seriously, only a tad) sloppy... but at least it's big enough (which, in and of itself, is cool, considering how hard it is to find a case that's big enough).But if you have a TPU case on your Samsung Infuse, then this really is the case for you......either that, or, if you want a brown one, then this case...[...]...is also large enough for an Infuse either with or without a TPU case.  In fact, that brown one is a millimeter or so larger on the inside, and so it can handle the shiny no-name TPU case better than can this black one.  But either case will handle the Infuse, with or without either kind of TPU case on it, and so those are my two cases that I now have... this black one for when I need a black case, and the above-linked-to brown one when I need a brown case.  And I'm happy (though, that said, I admit I still wish Rocketfish made one big enough).

{"reviewerID": "A11P105WVK5240", "asin": "B00GBFQWEG", "reviewerName": "Bocaboy \"BocaBoy\"", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This review of the uNu Aero is based on a free sample of the product that was supplied to me by the manufacturer in exchange for my evaluation and review of the product. I also want to mention that I am the owner of a uNu DX for an iPhone 5 which I purchased from Woot, a subsidiary of Amazon. A separate review of that product appears elsewhere on Amazon.I use my iPhone 5 extensively every day and put a large strain on the life of the battery. I've owned it since September of 2012 and I recently had to replace the battery because it had reached a level where it could no longer hold a charge. My usage only increases if I'm on a plane or away from home for an extended period of time. Under the best of circumstances I'm lucky if I get a  days charge out of my iPhone, and usually by late afternoon it hits the 20% mark. That's the reason that I started to check out battery cases for my iPhone 5 and originally chose the uNu DX. Over the last two weeks I've had the opportunity to check out the Aero case from uNu, and I'm impressed.The uNu Aero comes in two pieces. It uses a bumper-shaped border to attach the phone to the backplate, which contains the battery and charger. While it is better suited for a semi-permanent installation of an iPhone, it's easy enough to remove the case if necessary. On the other hand, the DX is a split case that allows for somewhat easier installation and removal of the iPhone and therefore better suited for occasional use when you know you'll be away from a charging source for the day.The Aero's non-slip case feels great in my hand and is much easier to grip than the phone itself. I can be on my iPhone for a long call and the phone feels comfortable and secure. It also looks like it would offer significant protection against drops and rough usage, although you'll forgive me if I didn't test that feature!The edges of the Aero case appear to be flush with the front surface of the phone. If you lay the phone face down, the case would allow the glass to touch the surface. This isn't a show-stopper for me, but if you're in a business environment where you've gotten into the habit of putting your phone face down for privacy, be aware that the Aero's case won't elevate the phone so as not to touch the surface and potentially creating the possibility of scratching the screen.The Aero's real claim to fame is the simplicity of charging the phone and the battery case. It has a flat, unobtrusive dock where you lay the battery case and it immediately starts charging! The phone comes on briefly to verify it, just as if you'd plugged it into a charging unit directly. The iPhone charges first, then the case. If both are fully drained you can expect about 4-5 hours for a full charge. If only the phone is discharged, figure about 2-3 hours. You can orient the Aero in any direction on the dock and it will still charge as long as the two nodes on the back of the back of the battery case touch the surface.The big differentiator for the Aero is its simplicity in charging both the battery case and the phone. I can't imagine it being any easier. I don't like to fuss with the micro USB cable on the uNu DX, trying to figure out which side is up or down, especially in dim light. (Unfortunately neither the Aero or DX can be charged using a Lightning connector.) With the Aero's charging dock, once it's set up, there are no cords to fuss with. Find a convenient place for the dock, then connect the micro USB plug to it, plug the large USB plug into any appropriate power source, and there's never any need to fool with the cables again. I have mine connected to an iHome radio on my bed stand that has a rear USB port. I drop it on the dock before I go to bed and grab it the next morning, with the phone and battery case fully charged. Seriously effortless.Using the Aero away from home to charge the iPhone battery is straightforward. There is a button on the lower back of the case. Hold it in for a few seconds and you'll see the battery indicator on your iPhone turn green, indicating that the case is charging the phone, exactly as if you'd connected it directly to a charger. And you can continue to use the phone while it's charging! Let the phone charge as it would normally and then turn off the battery case by holding down the button on the rear of Aero case..There are 4 LEDs on the back of the Aero, below the power button, that indicate how much of a charge is left on the battery case. My experience is that if you engage charging when the 20% power warning is displayed on the phone, the Aero will still have power left after the phone reaches 100%. That's a good thing since there are days when I've had to use that last remaining power to get me through the day before I get back to my hotel room.The Aero is slightly lighter than the DX, weighing in at 2.5 ounces versus the DX at 2.9 making it less obtrusive in your pocket. The Aero's battery is 2000 mAh versus 2300 for the DX. Both, however, are more than sufficient to fully charge an iPhone from 0% power. Trust me about this, I've been there!!If you plan to travel with the Aero, simply unplug the large USB side of the dock's cable from the power source, throw the dock in your suitcase with the other end of the cable attached, and you're ready to plug it in to a power source when you reach your destination. You can use either the white iPhone USB charging cube, a USB power source offered in many hotels, or the USB port of your computer.One note regarding the headphone jack. Both the DX and Aero have a cord that comes with the case that allows you to access the headphone jack. Unfortunately, the headphone jack is recessed deeply in the case so that it requires an adapter which is included with the phone. I use Bluetooth earbuds so this isn't a problem for me. If, however, you're using wired headphones or earbuds, you'll need to keep this small cord handy in your pocket or purse, or leave it attached to your earbuds or headphone cord. It's secure enough attached to that cord so that you won't lose it.The bottom line is that the Aero is a great battery case that is effortless to charge. For someone who has the need to juice-up their phone daily, the Aero is a great choice and as easy as can be to recharge. For those who only need extra phone power occasionally, the DX would be my choice. Either way these are both top-notch products from uNu.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An excellent battery case with effortless charging", "unixReviewTime": 1396656000, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2014"}

It is a nice replacement for a wallet case that wasn't quite as fancy that I had for my iPhone 4.  However, as with all cases for the iPhone 5 I find that I really don't like adding bulk to my phone for daily use.  That said, when I travel the convenience of having my phone, some cash and cards together along with protection for my phone is worth the added bulk. So for me this will be a useful travel case for my phone.The construction is nice and though it feels a little stiff right now, I expect it will soften up a bit over time as most of the cases seem to.  The one addition that would have been nice is either some sort of soft cloth cover over the card area or a screen protector for the iPhone glass.

They all ended up the same way: the microUSB connector failed, and Mophie's customer service was less than stellar, which led me to consider alternatives when I bought my iPhone 5.I first bought a Chinese power case that claimed 4200 mAh capacity. It turned out to be a total piece of junk; good thing it was cheap.I came across the Tylt by accident and since it had good reviews I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did.The case offers good protection while adding minimal bulk. It leaves all the glass exposed so you have no trouble dragging from the edges of the screen, like you might with some other cases. There still is a slight lip around the phone, which will protect the screen in case of a fall. I would have liked to see a slightly higher lip made of silicone or rubber, but this one is adequate and adds minimal bulk.Instead of a LED ramp like most batteries, this one features a single multicolor light: red for low, blue for medium, and green when high. A recessed button below the light lets you turn the power on or off when you press it for two seconds.There is ample power to give your iPhone 5 a full refill.The bottom of the case features a microUSB connector; the case comes with a USB to microUSB cable as well as a headphone jack extender, because most headphone jacks won't fit in the small opening for the headphone jack.The biggest issue with this case, and the reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars, is that the microUSB connector does not carry the data unlike its competitors, and Tylt is a little less than forthcoming about that (&#34;supports WiFi sync&#34; really means &#34;does not support USB sync&#34;). If your car radio supports USB iPhone connection, for instance, you'll have to take the phone out of the case or use bluetooth; and you'll have to use WiFi sync at home to transfer songs if you want to keep the phone in the case.I don't think it's a major issue, but it is a regrettable omission.When you connect the case to a power source, the phone is always charged first; once it has a full charge, the case starts charging without any user intervention -- perfect.Other than the lack of data connection, which will come as a surprise to most seasoned charging case users, the Tylt Power Case is flawless.

Cimo had a similar hybrid with frost clear back.  Supcase had a similar product too, but the back was clear.So I took a chance.  This is a very attractive case on the One.  The black trim on Silver back provides a nice contrast.  There are cutouts for everything except the volume buttons.  I tested the volume buttons first since some cases make it difficult to press the buttons.  No so with this case.  Very easy to press.The cutout for the rear facing mic leaves plenty of room between the mic and cutout (the mic is perfectly centered within the cutout).  The bottom mic is a bit off-center within the bottom cutout, but it's far enough from the material.  Cutouts for LED and rear facing camera match the pics that accompany the product description.  Cutouts for power/IR and headphone jack are centered.Case is very snug (I like that).  Bumper provides a nice grip since it is textured.  There is a good sized lip on the case that will protect the screen when placed faced down on a flat surface.Once concern with other brands is that the hard material sometimes separates from the TPU material.

Brackin", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "I have had my Galaxy Note 2 for about three weeks and I am still enjoying it every day. This phone stands out from the pack by offering a 5.5&#34; display and a highly sensitive Stylus Pen. Samsung is becoming the premium Android Phone company and their products are very popular. One things that makes this phone stand out compared to other Android phones is Samsung's Touchwiz interface. Touchwiz is Samsung's way of customizing your Android experience and provides many enhancements to the default Android UI. One thing that I love is that Samsung uses Badges (like the iPhone) to notify you of incoming messages and emails. It makes it very easy to glance at your phone and see if you've missed anything.This phone packs a lot of features that further cause it to stand out. There are a wide number of gestures that you can setup for the device. An example is that you can tilt the phone to go from screen to screen and you can also double-tap the top of the phone to move to the top of a list. You can also choose to have the phone stay awake while you are looking at it. These are all neat little touches that show an appreciated attention to detail by Samsung.For me the phone will easily last all day on a single battery charge. The battery is very impressive compared to other phones that I have owned in the past. Another nice feature is Samsung's Music Hub. This software allows you to upload your music Library to Samsung's Cloud (including from iTunes) and then listen to the music from the cloud without taking up any space on your phone.The front of the device feels very high quality and the screen is vibrant and responsive. It handles every modern Android game that I've thrown at it. I have tried many many Apps on the phone and I have not encountered any that were not compatible or that did not work correctly. All the major Apps are available from Dropbox to HBOgo.The only negatives that I would point out are that this large screen is only 1280x720. Other large phones boast a full 1920x1080 resolution which means higher pixel density and sharper images. The screen on the Note 2 doesn't look bad by any means, but this is obviously one area where Samsung cut corners. The other gripe is that the back of the phone is just a thin piece of plastic. This doesn't match the high quality of the rest of the device and could potentially be easily broken. The camera produces nice images, but is laggy. So don't expect to capture high-quality action photos with it.I would strongly encourage users to invest in a case to keep the back protected.Overall this is a fantastic phone and you would be hard pressed to find another that offers this level of quality and features. It will easily do everything that you ask of it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fantastic Large Android Phone", "unixReviewTime": 1370649600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2013"}

Oh", "helpful": [2, 3], "reviewText": "I came across David Pogue's review of Bluetooth headphones in the New York Times and researched the three sets he mentioned. Compared to the other's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime. I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house. The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile' to operate with the Jabra as a music player. Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i couldn't use the headsets for music was disappointing. As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design. After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC. However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers wouldn't work on either application. The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer. On the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price), comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren't audiophiles. The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up (15 feet seems to be the max)and on a minor note the flashing LED's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device. Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but.

Lazaro", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "*Mpow FreeGo*Over the course of the years I&#8217;ve tried many, many Bluetooth headsets and VERY few lasted more than a few days of use.  A lot had poor performance, extremely uncomfortable or both.I travel a lot and sometimes it&#8217;s just cumbersome having to hold the phone when talking and trying to multitask.  So I gave the FreeGO a try and I&#8217;m glad I did.*Performance/Build Quality*When first looking at the unit; I was worried it was going to be too heavy with the size but I was pleasantly surprised when picking it up.  It&#8217;s a lot lighter than I expected.  Even though it was light weight it didn&#8217;t feel cheap in the slightly.  Nothing flexed, or creaked to the point where I was worried about it falling apart.The unit itself has a two toned looked to it.  A shiny glossy part and matte soft rubber part.  The soft rubber part is what actually is in contact with your ear.  This makes it extremely comfortable to wear.  So comfortable that I&#8217;d forget I had it on to be honest.  The silicone ear tip that creates a &#8220;seal&#8221; for sound doesn&#8217;t really create a seal as the tip is oddly &#8220;flat&#8221; shaped.  It&#8217;s not like the tips on earphones/earbuds where you would jam them in your ear canal.  It simply hovers over the opening.  This worried me at first that calls or sounds would be difficult to hear.  Once again it surprised me.  Calls still came in crystal clear, music sounded good and never missed a notification sound.  I think the odd shape and not shoving them in the ear canal is what makes the headset so comfortable.Can be used on either ear.  The earpiece has a 180 Degree Flip-boom arm for both left or right ear.  Which is really convenient depending which ear you want to use it on.The unit has 3 buttons: Volume up, volume down and answer call.  All were easy to access when worn and always responsive.  Pairing it to my phone or tablet was a cinch and took no longer than 2 minutes for initial pairing and subsequent pairings took seconds.Sound quality was just amazing.  Never did I feel like it wasn&#8217;t clear.  The mic also performed superbly.  The person on the line never had a problem hearing me or asked me to speak louder.  What else can you ask for?Last; it stayed in place.  I&#8217;m sure everyone had that headset that was just impossible to keep in place and you ended adjusting it all the time.  Not this one; I had it on the ENTIRE day and not once did I have to adjust it.*Packaging*It comes in a simple box.  Has 3 different ear tips, a small faux leather pouch and a micro usb cable (flat cable which is a nice touch).  The micro usb cable is of decent quality which is a plus in my book.  It did not come with a wall plug though.  So either use your phones or plug it into your computer to charge it.*Conclusion*It&#8217;s a no brainer for me if you&#8217;re looking for a great value Bluetooth headset.  Good performance, good price and comfortable.  I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Bang for Buck Bluetooth Headset!", "unixReviewTime": 1402012800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2014"}

As a result, I end up carrying her ID and debit card(s). This, in and of itself is not a problem until the next day I go to work with her cards in my wallet because I forgot to give them back! Anyway, back to the review!! The price on this item is awesome and it does exactly what it's supposed to. I read a couple of other reviews on here about phones not fitting and whatnot, but her phone fit just fine. In case it matters, she has the Galaxy S III from Verizon. I know the size of phone models shouldn't change from carrier to carrier, but it's possible that one is slightly smaller or larger due to cellular technology differences causing this case not to fit.One minor complaint is that on the pink one, the plastic piece that holds the phone is colored red which makes it stand out against the pink case and white phone. It's not terribly bad, but I wonder why they didn't just make it pink to match the rest of the case.As far as convenience, this case sucks when you have to use the phone! It's bulky and depending on how many cards you're able to jam into the slots, it'll make wielding this thing a nightmare when it's up to your head. Plus, it looks like you're holding a wallet up to your ear which might make people wonder about you. :) However, in this texting-obsessed culture we now live in, I doubt this would be a problem with many people. But if it is, the case is surprisingly easy to take off...almost too easy. It feels as though the phone could fall out with a modest bump.If you're on the fence about getting this, think about a few things first:1. This case is designed mostly for aesthetic appeal as well as some slight convenience. These points will likely only be benefited by women.2. While the case feels tough and sturdy, it doesn't hold the phone very tightly. This is great for being able to rip the device out to take a quick call, but potentially bad if you drop the phone. (We didn't do a drop test, so this is just an assumption on my part.)3. While it's great to have your cards with your phone so you don't have to carry a purse or wallet, it would suck to lose your phone with all of your money and ID as well.My girlfriend will likely only use this case if going to a bar or club and stick to a standard case when carrying the phone normally.

I&#8217;m happy to tell you that your search can end, as these Avantree Jogger Pro bluetooth headphones will solve these woes once and for all. I&#8217;ve been using them for the past week while exercising, and not once have they even changed position in my ears. Often, headphones that do stay in place experience discomfort after sometime, as they put pressure on your ears. However, that&#8217;s not the case with these. They&#8217;re so lightweight and comfortable that I often forget I have them on!The controls on these headphones are great too. In my experience, they worked almost instantaneously, and were very intuitive and easy to use. Another great feature of these headphones is Bluetooth 4.0 and aptX. For those of you who don&#8217;t know what this means for these headphones, it basically means the headphones use less power to connect to your device, and can connect to two devices at once. In my tests, the headphones were able to switch almost instantaneously from music playing on my computer to another song being played on my iPhone, for example.Pros:-Lightweight and comfortable-Fit extremely well-small form factor, so are easily portable-Great and clear sound quality-EXTREMELY long battery life (13 hours in my tests)-Decently quick recharging time (2-3 hours in my tests)-Great range - about 20 feet in my tests-sweatproof (I accidentally spilled water on these at the gym, and they still held up!)-Come with a great carrying pouch that fits both the headphones and the charging cableCons:-microphone doesn&#8217;t pick up sound that well when answering calls-uses a proprietary cable for rechargingThese headphones have become my everyday pair that I use not only when exercising, but also for listening to music in general. The Bluetooth capability and connection strength of these is unmatched compared to similar items on the market. I highly recommend these headphones if you&#8217;re looking for a pair for exercising, everyday use with listening to music, or wireless talking.I was provided with this item free of charge in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation.

It is the sequel to Google and HTC's Nexus One (incorrectly regarded as a flop) and like the iPhone 4 it sets the bar for the current generation of smart phones.I bought this phone on its release day, so I am very familiar with what it can do. I came from using aNokia N900 Unlocked Phone/Mobile Computer with 3.5-Inch Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, Maemo Browser, 32 GB--U.S. Version with Full Warrantywhich was another great unlocked phone. But this year alone has seen a lot of improvements in what phones can do.The Nexus S, made by Samsung, is a gorgeous gadget.  It is a little underwhelming in person, glossy all-black, but its a sleak package and it has some definite power under the hood.  The 1GHz Hummingbird processor absolutely blows through apps, I have not experienced anything I would consider lag.  I've encountered latency and bad apps, but those are not the phone's fault. The Gingerbread version of Android is a real stunner.  I still read about issues with 2.2 (Froyo) and just have to shrug because this phone does very well with every app i've installed.The camera(s) and other features function very well.  The optics of this camera are not all that impressive, but the software behind the camera works very well and even resource hungry apps like Photoshop Express function very nicely on the Nexus S. As for displaying those pictures, this is one of the most beautiful displays on any phone. The \"contour\" glass is curved just enough to be comfortable when held up to your ear, and it separates it from all the \"slabs\". The glass coating is wonderful to touch and fingerprints wipe off without a lot of smearing.One of the big gripes I've heard since this phone was announced was that it lacked an SD card.  I was nervous stepping down to a 16GB phone after having 32GB plus an SD card slot on the n900, but now I do not miss it. The streaming apps (youtube, last.fm) do a great job of keeping me entertained and I've gotten quite good at plugging in to my computer every so often to move media onto and off of the device.  An interesting thing to note: The 16GB is partitioned similar to a phone with SD card, So you have about 2GB of \"root\" space- where the apps and actual Android OS stay, and then the 14GB \"SD\" partition that will be unmounted when you connect your phone to a computer (if that didn't make sense to you, don't worry). You can move apps onto the \"SD\" partition. In short, I have not missed having a huge hard drive on this thing.The other gripe is \"No 4G\" and this one is more of a \"religious debate\".  We are only seeing the tip of 4G.  Every carrier claims to have 4G service, but that's a debatable statement. Its pretty clear that carriers didn't even roll out 3G as much as they could have, so really we're waiting for proper high speed connection of any sort in most areas of the country.  If you are one of the fortunate few who lives in 4G land, and you KNOW that you need extreme speeds NOW (and you won't travel anywhere, because then you're back to 3G or EDGE pretty quick) then this is not the phone for you. For the majority of people, 3G speeds are quite adequate for the majority of applications (both software and usage) that people will use, the phone is also 802.11 b/g/n compatible, so using wifi will improve your experience over many 4G connections.  Consider also that you get tethering for free with this phone (a very nice feature that makes any Wifi device far more mobile so long as you have your Nexus S with you).Now on to the Nexus S's unlocked status. Is it expensive to buy a phone without a contract? of course, you are only paying for the phone once.  If you do the math  it is cheaper in the long run (and you have more freedom) if you buy your phone and choose your carrier. Also take into consideration that Google will send the Nexus S Android updates before any other phone on any carrier gets them in the US.  This shortcuts all the \"fractured\" issues with different manufacturers and carriers limiting your access to the latest Android software. This phone's usability will be extended because of it. There is no carrier in the way who will want you to upgrade to get the next batch of features for Android, instead you're plugged directly (or more directly) to the source.  That is a big advantage.UPDATE: Having now used this phone daily for a few months, I am still very pleased.  The main comment complement I get when people notice the screen and just how good videos look on it (even rather low quality youtube videos).  Having Gingerbread on here is a real treat (ha ha). Its a shame I can't recommend certain apps (like Google's Navigation or certain widget functionality) since its running a version of Android that isn't available to my other 'Droid brethren and I feel like a snob explaining how this is practically the only phone with the latest OS.About the only thing I miss on this phone is an LED to indicate incoming messages when the screen is off. And I have noticed a weird quirk where the phone will randomly reboot itself. This is a known glitch that should be resolved with the next update to Gingerbread (2.3.3).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent phone", "unixReviewTime": 1296000000, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2011"}

Choppy audio, duplicate music files, poor music file tagging, unplayable podcast files from the Store, and buggy SD card support plagued all of them.Some of these items remain with the Lumia 920, but this must have an updated version of the OS, because things are improved. Audio no longer stutters and there are no problems with duplicate music files. Music file tagging is still broken, especially album and artist artwork, but I was able to fix most of the artwork via the MPATool app. The Xbox Music connection option does not fix any of this. It's actually sad that Microsoft's built-in music solution is such a huge step back from WP7, and it remains as my biggest complaint about WP8. Microsoft seems to want you to use their online Xbox Music service instead of CD rips.Podcast files from the Store play perfectly. However, you cannot manually add podcast files to your phone and have them show up in your Podcast section. If you manually add podcast files to your phone, they will show up in the Music section, which is strange. Sorting options are not as varied as it was in WP7.This is one of the few WP8 devices that has 32 gigs of storage, which is great for a guy like me who stores his entire music collection on the phone, and I download a lot of Podcasts. It's a shame more phones don't come with this much storage. I picked a phone with this amount of storage to avoid using a micro SD card.I bought an unlocked version so I can use my T-Mobile sim card. As of August 28, 2013, the phone has not received the GDR2 \"Amber\" update, which is a shame. Nokia's website says it's still in testing, so hopefully this phone will get it soon.Of all of the WP8 devices I have used, this one offers the best experience. The OS has some flaws when it comes to the way it handles media, but you can work around them for the most part. The rest of the OS is exceptional. It's slick, pretty, and has plenty of applications. The live tiles are really cool and give the OS a unique look and feel.The hardware is great. The screen is big and beautiful. The 1280x768 screen is crisp and clear. The phone is rectangular, but with curved edges. It's almost too big to be a pocket phone, but not quite. The 1.5 GHz dual core CPU makes for a very smooth user experience. Compared to my old Samsung Focus, all applications and games are noticeably faster.If this model received quicker OS updates, it would be a serious contender for the top WP8 device. As is, it's still an excellent phone.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great but flawed OS on a nearly perfect phone", "unixReviewTime": 1378252800, "reviewTime": "09 4, 2013"}

Let me explain...I purchased a glossy red Nokia 920 on November 9th (Launch Day) at the local ATT store. Personally, I wanted to give the yellow version a try, but the store only had the red, black, white, and gray versions available. So, I paid $450 for the red phone \"off-contract\" and also received the wirelesss charging device (black) at no charge. When I decided to buy the Nokia, I was upgrading from my trusty HTC TITAN (AWESOME phone, btw!) and wanted to experience Microsoft's new mobile operating system. Windows Phone 8 is a fast and stable OS, which offers some enhancements not available on earlier models. Setting up my phone was extremely easy and you are offered very clear instructions on the device. Most of the AT&T; employees I met are not very savvy on Windows Phone devices, so I made sure I was the one setting up the device at the store. Upon entering my Windows Live info, I was pleasantly surprised to find that all my contacts transferred extremely fast (took less than a minute to transfer). Apps and media, however, required more time. By the way, the excellent Zune software used on Windows Phone 7.5 devices is incompatible with this phone. However, if you have Windows 7 on your PC, you can use Windows Explorer to transfer media files. If you have Windows 8 or a Mac, there's an app for transferring media to your phone. Also, there are some WP 7.5 apps which are not compatible with Windows Phone 8. For example, the Xbox LIVE game called \"The Harvest\" is currently incompatible and won't even show up in a Marketplace search when you use the Nokia 920. Update (2/16/13): Some apps are already being ported over to WP8, so it will take some time for this to happen.After about a day of using the Nokia Lumia 920, I noticed the battery discharged to 50% in two hours. I wasn't using it that much during those two hours, but when I was on YouTube, the Lumia's case got extremely hot. This led me to believe that there was a problem with the battery, because my HTC TITAN never had that type of problem. Anyway, I returned it to the ATT store and replaced it with a glossy white version. Now, my new Nokia Lumia 920 works fine and doesn't have any of the battery problems found on the red one I returned. Aside from the battery issue on my first phone, I really like the Lumia 920!Pros:- Nice high resolution screen w/ Gorilla Glass- Solid and beautiful case- Outstanding still camera and video records at 1080p- Camera can be upgraded, using software \"lenses\". These enhancements bring additional features to the device!- Dedicated camera button- Great Nokia apps- Great Marketplace layout- Quality WP apps (Check out \"MetroTube\")- Good sound- 32GB memory- NFC compliant- Xbox LIVE games- Drag and drop media onto phone- Wireless charging is built-in (requires special charger)- Full PC/Mac compatibility- The SkyDrive app allows fantastic integration with your cloud filesCons:- No expandable memory! That is probably my biggest gripe about this phone.- Can't transfer or purchase Zune videos to the phone (at least, I couldn't)- Heavy (but its a solid device)- No custom alert or notification sounds (custom ringtones and alarms only)- Marketplace still missing some major apps found on other platforms- Wish it had a 4.7\" screen or larger, like my HTC TITAN (I do notice the difference in screen size)- No longer uses the Zune softwareOverall, I'm happy with the phone and have no regrets. I would certainly recommend this device to anyone looking for a Windows Phone device or a just a great smartphone.UPDATE - 2/6/13: I was asked if a data plan is required to use this phone. Well, the answer is yes and no. Yes, if you plan on using it on the carrier's cellular network. AT&T;, for example, will receive notification that you are using a smartphone to make calls and will charge you for data usage. On the other hand, if you don't intend to use it as a cellular phone and don't access the 3G/4G networks, you can use it as an Internet device. In other words, you can use Skype to make phone calls over wi-fi, continue to download and use apps, take pictures and video, and surf the Internet over wi-fi. I used to do that with my old HTC Titan (Windows Phone 7.5) without any problems.Bottom-line: Highly recommend this phone for someone who wants a powerful, \"does-all\" device! If you are tied deeply to iOS and/or Android and can't handle change, the transition might not be so great. However, five solid stars for this device!!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Nokia Lumia 920 is an Excellent Smartphone!

She also wanted a smaller one than the one I have (HTC EVO V). This model wasn't available when I got mine, and honestly- despite the fact that it's a lower end device- I like it more than the EVO.First off, this device is considerably lighter and more compact than the EVO, and I like the angled bottom. It makes it easier to hold, and despite its slender form it still has a solid feel.It has a 5 MP camera which is essentially the same as one of the two cameras on the EVO V. To be honest, I've hardly used the 3D picture feature on my EVO so for all intents and purposes this is the same thing. The camera is also flush with the back, not jutting out.Performance is good, and while it has only 512 MB of RAM it's really good enough for anything except maybe some 3D games. If you care about such things, then yeah- get an iPhone, EVO, or Galaxy. If not, this is really quite good enough. The device has most standard features: bluetooth, micro-SD slot, GPS, etc.The device runs Android 4.0 ICS and is generally very responsive. The screen is very bright and clear, and although it's not exactly a retina display it's fine for general tasks like browsing and email.The micro-SD slot isn't externally located, but it's the next best thing. You pop off the bottom panel where the antenna is, and there it is. No need to power it off, pry off the whole back panel, and take out the battery. Internal memory has about 1 GB free.Oh, and on a sidenote, it is a 3G device- not 4G. However, I've found that 4G coverage is so bad in my area that it really makes no difference. If 4G is a selling point for you, you should definitely check the service map before you decide on anything.In short, although it isn't the powerhouse that the EVO V is, I actually wish I'd gotten this one instead.

One end is a straight plug that goes into the headphone and the other end is a right-angle plug that goes into the music device. The on-cord 3 button control is made for Apple devices. The detachable cord means it is replaceable since the cord is usually the part that gets damaged first in headphones and earphones.How does the headphones actually perform? Well, it blew my expectation. It sounds AMAZING. It's clean and full of details, with very strong bass and good treble. I think it sounds as good as the more expensive Sennheiser Amperior and Shure 1840. The active noise canceling works great too, elminating most of the outside ambient noise. One thing I want to point out is that UE 6000 continues to work even after the batteries are spent, unlike a lot of other noise canceling headphones. However, without batteries, the sound lacks real quality and power, perhaps due to the the fact that not only the noise canceling circuit but the on-board amp is no longer powered. Therefore, in order to have good performance, you will want it powered at all times. Logitech rated the battery life to be about 40 hours.UE 6000 is a high quality headset with a great soundstage. It's foldable and very comfortable to wear (even for hours) which makes it ideal for portable use. The included zippered pouch is functional and protects the folded headset when not in use. The blue detachable cord is eye catching and may open the way for third party custom cords. At $200 retail, it's a great buy for its features and performance. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I'm thoroughly impressed", "unixReviewTime": 1351123200, "reviewTime": "10 25, 2012"}

BUT they sent me a free replacement!Nothing lasts forever, right?  So when the earpiece on my V1 headset began to separate from the body, I was disappointed, but figured I got my money's worth.  So I went ahead and bought a replacement from Amazon cuz I still love this headset -- it's the best I've used, bar none.  But before my replacement even arrived, I remembered BlueAnt offers a 2 year warranty, so I called them up on a whim and explained the problem and they gave me an RA number.  I mailed my broken V1 in and about 1 week later, they sent me a free replacement in full retail packaging!!!  By now, the replacement I ordered form Amazon arrived but I decided to keep both and save one as a spare.  Moral of the story - BlueAnt has awesome customer service and is the V1 is still the best in my book!And now back to my original review...This headset is amazing!! I bought this primarily for the noise and echo canceling feature and I have to say it works like a charm.  I checked out other noise & echo canceling headsets like the Motorola H710 but it looks exactly like my H700 which in my opinion has big design flaws.  Motorola should've done more to upgrade the headset's look and function.  As it is, the 710 is just a boring retread.  But what really sold me on the BlueAnt was the dual microphones.I've done a lot of recording work and know how difficult it can be to eliminate ambient noise, so the concept of dual mics was a revolutionary idea that made total sense to me.  Liken it to having two eyes - you can see everything with just one, but when you look with both eyes, there's more depth, clarity and accuracy with what you're seeing. Well, the same is true with hearing with two ears or a headset with two microphones.  The two mics are the secret to the superior noise & echo canceling of this headset. But don't take my word for it, listen for yourself online.I went to the manufacturer's website and watched a video showing a guy using the BlueAnt headset in action in a noisy bar.  First they just showed the guy talking normally in the bar and you could hear all the ambient noise around him, and that alone was enough to give me a headache (a big reason why I hate places like that.) Then the guy picks up his cell phone and turns on his BlueAnt and they let you hear actual audio from the headset with just normal noise canceling on, and it cut the ambient noise in the bar drastically!  Just on the normal setting! Then the guy turns on max noise canceling and the ambient noise all but disappears!!  No kidding!!  His voice did sound a bit tinnier as a result of all the filtering, but that's to be expected.  You'd never use max canceling in normal situations, just in circumstances where you need to take a call in a noisy location and being heard is paramount.  In any case, the video was quite impressive and a brilliant marketing move.  So I'm wondering if it's just doctored in some way, but the dual mic concept has me sold and the video has me intrigued enough to try it out.  I believe the guy in the video is using a Z9i and supposedly the V1 is even better at noise canceling which is why I chose it.  The two headsets are identical other than color and that the V1 also has voice control.At first, I was wondering if I needed voice control or not.  I also wasn't clear if I could still use my phone's built in voice control with the V1, but the answer turns out to be YES, you can.  You just give the voice command, phone commands, to access your phone's own voice commands.  It's very simple and I like having the option to use either the headset or my phone's voice control.  At first I thought it would be an either or, using one or the other.  As it turns out, I find myself using both for different situations.  And I absolutely love-Love-LOVE that you can ask the headset how much battery life is left!  With no accurate visual indicators on most headsets, like the disappearing battery bars on cell phones that at least give you a clue where you're at, I was always trying to estimate how much I'd used my headset so I could figure out if I needed to recharge it or not.  It's not good to overcharge things so I was always doing the math in my head.  Now, all I have to do is ask, and the little genie in the headset tells me!!  That alone is worth having the V1 over the Z9i in my opinion!So overall, I have to say this is a pretty awesome headset.  When I buy something new, I want it to actually be new, as in, the latest technology.  I always check the item's description to see when it was first available on Amazon and don't buy when I see a product is a year old or more.  Technology is changing everyday, so don't waste your money buying something new that isn't really new since it's been on the market over 12 months.  It's already old, useless junk by then.  The V1 is newly released so it's the latest technology and as a result, won't be obsolete for a while.  This is a great headset and you won't be disappointed!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Noise & Echo Canceling Really Works!!

With 2 iPad&#8217;s and 2 iPhones as well as a few other devices, I knew that I needed a powerful unit to keep all of them running.  After using it during week long trip and in other situations since then, here are my impressions.Design:I like the look of the unit, since it is square not rectangular it is easier to fit into small pockets.  In fact it is small enough that it will fit in the smallest pocket of my laptop bag which can&#8217;t be said of some of the other chargers.The finish on this device is perfect.  It is matte and not shiny at all.  I have had batteries in the past that have had more of a shiny finish and they attract fingerprints which just make them annoying.  If my fingers are really greasy it will show on this unit, but it is not a constant struggle as it can be with other units.The unit is plastic, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like a cheap plastic.  I am not afraid that it will crack apart after a small drop.I do really like the fact that it comes with a cloth bag.  Since this unit is used for travel and mobility, there are times where it is thrown into a backpack, laptop and I it is nice to have it protected from scratches.Function:This unit has performed amazingly well.  I was able to charge 2 iPhones at the same time, as well as my iPad and have never had problems with not having enough power.  This really is the end goal, to have power when I need it and not have to worry about running out.  The large battery makes this unit a necessity for travel or to have when I am not around an electrical outlet.The fact that it has 2 USB ports is great as it makes this device a lot more functional that it would have been with 1 port.The micro-USB connection for input is very easy to use to charge the device and I have not had any problems with charging the unit.Overall this is a great charger for any mobile device!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Product!", "unixReviewTime": 1386806400, "reviewTime": "12 12, 2013"}

While I find the Speck case perfect for that task, I also wanted a holster to keep the phone at my side when not in use so I wouldn't leave it somewhere.I searched Amazon for a larger holster that could accommodate the iPhone in the Speck case. After reading the description and reviews, the Reiko seemed like it fit the need. Several reviews said the Reiko worked with their iPhones in Otterbox Commuter cases which appears to be a similar form factor to the Speck.Bottom line, the case is almost perfect for me. The things I like about the case are:- Inexpensive, under $10- Belt clip is very secure- Belt loops for both horizontal and vertical orientation- Well made, no loose strings or unfinished edges- Big enough to hold iPhone in Speck case- Padded for extra protectionThe only thing I would change would be to have the holster ride lower when clipped to my belt.  It rides high in the vertical orientation with the top of the holster a good inch and a half above the top of the belt. Because I'm a big guy (aka heavy), when I sit down my sides hang over my belt and the holster digs into my side. Not an issue when I'm standing or walking and also not an issue when using the horizontal belt loop.  I can't knock a star off, because I could also fix the issue by losing some weight.By design, the Speck case I use is very high grip,  anti-skid with raised rubber grips over most of the outside of the case. That feature, combined with the initial stiffness of the holster, made it a two handed affair to extract the phone from the holster.

Once it is paired for the first time, the next time connecting is so easy!2) Sound Quality / LoudnessLOUDNESS - For a smaller speaker, in the shower even with the water on full force, the sound is VERY LOUD (can be turned down).*Helpful hint for you about loudness: First, if you plan on listening to songs from your Playlist from your phone on this, adjust the phone's sound FIRST to your liking and louder than you think because you will need it kind of loud in the shower. Also you can turn the volume UP OR DOWN on the Bluetooth speaker by using the top or bottom (on the left side)buttons.SOUND QUALITY on this speaker:The sound quality is very good to excellent for such a small unit. So I compared this to a larger Bluetooth Speaker that I own and use (that is not waterproof one like this one is) that I have and the sound was very, very close in sound quality and loudness. The overall Treble is quite good and for me, the Bass is pretty good as well. This is a huge plus for this Bluetooth speaker!3) FM Radio - Since I live on top of a hill and near a mountain and lots of trees, usually I cannot get FM that well in Bluetooth types of devices/radios. However, this one was able to CLEARLY pickup two of my favorite stations loud and clear and they stayed on while in the shower.CONS:1) The device's Power On has many multi-purposes on it. Personally, I would have preferred to see a dedicated BLUETOOTH ON/OFF button and also a POWER ON/OFF Button. As it is now this ONE BUTTON does all of these:--Turns on the device--Turns on Bluetooth.--Turns off Bluetooth--Turn on the FM Radio.--Serves as a charging indicator (when you turn it off and then plug in the USB cable, then the light changes to a NON BLINKING RED. This unit took some patience on my part because of the Power Button doing too many things at once, but I was able to get it working fine and this is just a very minor thing really for me personally.Overall, I like this speaker OK, it is loud and clear, but there are two things I really DO NOT LIKE AT ALL:1) The charger that came with this is propriety, and should I misplace or lose this, I cannot charge this speaker.2) The unit is really too loud in my opinion. It always begins VERY loud and does not keep the level of loudness where I last set it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Works OK but has a proprietary charger", "unixReviewTime": 1386633600, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2013"}
{"reviewerID": "A2BMZRO0H7TFCS", "asin": "B00DIOALPE", "reviewerName": "Ed", "helpful": [302, 327], "reviewText": "I'm a headphone buff and I've also had more than a dozen Bluetooth headsets over the years.  However, I haven't used many Bluetooth stereo earphones, so I was very excited to give the BackBeat GO 2 a try.PROS:- Very good sound quality for Bluetooth- Good bass response- Easy to pair and use- Sweat/water resistant- Pair up to 8 devicesCONS:- Poor battery life- Cable can snag on your neck during workoutsCOMFORTThe BackBeat GO 2 (BBG2) weighs just 14 grams and is reasonably comfortable to wear.  My ears did ache a little and felt itchy after wearing them for a couple of hours straight, but that's not unlike most other earphones.  The BackBeat GO 2 uses rubber \"stabilizers\" to help keep the speakers safely in your ears so if you wear them during your fitness activities, they won't fall out.  They're similar to the design used in some of Plantronics' Bluetooth mono headsets.  The BBG2 comes with the medium eartips installed as well as another set of small and large tips.SOUND QUALITYFor a Bluetooth earphone that doesn't support aptX, the BBG2 sounds very good.  I enjoyed listening to music with them, including lots of modern music that have lots of bass.  Movies were also fun to watch and the good bass response helped in scenes with lots of special effects and explosions.  As with any earphone, it's important to get a proper seal to get the best sound quality and the BBG2 is no different.  Plantronics stresses this point frequently in their literature.DESIGN & FEATURESThe BBG2 isn't completely \"wireless,\" per se, because the left and right speakers are attached via a short cable with a remote attached.  However, you aren't tethered to your computer, phone or tablet, which is especially useful when working out at the gym.  The BBG2 is sweat-proof and water resistant, but I found the rubbery cable would snag on the back of my neck during workouts.  It's not a huge deal and myAudio-Technica ATH-CKP500BL SonicSportsdo the same thing, but thought it was worth mentioning.Pairing the BBG2 is easy and done via the inline remote.  Conveniently, it can pair up to 8 devices, so you can have all your computers, tablets, and phones paired up and ready to use at any time.BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on the BBG2 is really its only downfall.  Five hours of talk time and 4.5 hours of stereo listening is not very long.  On the bright side, it fully charges via micro USB in only 2.5 hours.  You can also download a battery meter app for iOS or a battery life widget for Android.  There's a version of the BBG2 with a battery case for about $20 more, that adds an additional 10 hours of life.  I really think Plantronics should've made the battery case standard for the BBG2.  Even if you have your own external battery charger (I do), you may want to save its charge for your phone or tablet, not your earphones.CONCLUSIONThe Plantronics BackBeat Go 2 is an excellent stereo Bluetooth earphone that's hampered only by poor battery life.  It sounds great, is easy to use, and really convenient.  If you're willing to charge it frequently, the BackBeat Go 2 is definitely a stereo BT earphone worth trying.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great sound and easy to use", "unixReviewTime": 1375660800, "reviewTime": "08 5, 2013"}

Unfortunately that did not last. The part of the case that holds the door and the hinge together snapped off and essentially the case came apart.Luckily for me Spigen announced that they would cover this cases for an extra 2 years or so with their new cases and I was told on twitter that it also applied to their past cases (I forget exact coverage years). I was able to get a replacement by sending them photos via twitter and email and I honestly expected to get brand new case but no. What I got was a replacement door. I contacted them again and sent them better photos and told them that the door is not the only thing broken. They apologized and sent me the plastic cover that holds the hinge and door and goes over the silicone portion of the case. At this point I just gave up and used what they gave me since it worked...for a month.That same plastic part of the case broke and the door continues to pop out now but they have not responded to my twitter complaints and frankly I am tired of their slow service so a negative review it is.I have never dropped my phone, banged it or let if take any damage.

First, it's best to determine your likely use (multiple devices, a power-hungry tablet, only a single smart phone, etc.) and how often you expect to need the extra power.  This Bolse power bank fully charges my iPhone 5 two-and-a-half  times, which really equates into three or four sessions since I plug in my phone when it gets to 25% or so.  While it will charge an iPad, it doesn't have enough power to charge the 3rd-gen iPad more than a third or so.  The 5200 mAh size is perfect if your often run-down your phone, if you travel, or if you want to to give your tablet enough juice to, say, finish watching a movie.  A larger battery is a must for frequent tablet use, and a smaller one might be in order for infrequent smartphone use.  This size is a good intermediate one -- not too large to be bulky but with a large enough capacity for a variety of devices.  It takes about 7 hours to charge the battery using a wall adapter.The dual ports are great to have.  When I'm on vacation, I can charge both my iPhone 5 (with my own cable) and my camera at the same time.  This battery will charge anything that can get power through a USB cable, although, if the included connectors/adapters don't fit, you'll have to use your own cable.  The battery feels and looks solid, with comfortable curves that fit in my hand.  It measures 3.75\" x 2\" x 1\" at the widest points of each dimension.

It seems to have the feel of a well-made product, not a super light cheap feel you find in some Bluetooth headsets.I found the instruction manual to be clear and concise, following the manual was a breeze. Charging the device is simple, it has an indicator light that changes colors as you move through the charging process, red for charging, yellow for medium charge, and green for fully charged.The controls on the device are conveniently placed, the on/off switch is placed on the bottom away from the other controls. The volume controls are placed on the outside of the device with volume down control near the bottom of the outside and the volume up near the top of the outside. Both are marked accordingly with \"-\" for volume down and \"+\" for volume up. The answer/end call button is located on the outside middle of the device; it protrudes out so as to not confuse it with the volume controls.  Answering and ending calls is easy, one push to answer and one push to end call, or one of my favorite features,  two quick pushes to refuse an incoming call.The headset fits comfortably in my ear, the ear gels and the ear hooks keep it snug and in place. I am impressed by the volume on this device as well, at low volume you can clearly understand the person on the other end, and at high volumes the sound doesn't become distorted.I don't utilize Skype very often but set up was fairly quick, and my calls have been problem free.This is easily the best Bluetooth device I have owned, I highly recommend it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Best blue tooth I've ever used by a long shot", "unixReviewTime": 1331683200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2012"}

For the most part, most of the features carried over from the older headset, but a few features changed for the worse.  The headset is paired with an HTC TouchPro 2.Pros:1. Pairing is easy and quick and I have had no issues with losing the pairing or having to reconfigure the bluetooth settings.  Very easy setup.2. Voice quality remains strong as in the previous model.3. I like the fact this is an over-the-ear headset.  I don't like sticking something in my ear.4. Voice commands work well and are very smooth.  Of course, there are times when my phone doesn't understand, but that could be background noise or just poor voice recognition on the phone's part.  For the most part, it seems to do better than the previous model.5.  Range is much better than the previous model and I get a audible signal when I get in or out of range, which is a nice feature.Cons:1. Button on the side of the headset has been moved too far back and is \"softer.\"  It is probably just a matter of getting used to pushing further back than on the previous model, but I find that if you don't press it directly on the center of the button, it won't activate the commands, so I end up pressing it several times to get a response.2. Even though it is almost identical to the older H710 version, the ear clip doesn't fit on my ear as well.  The older version would wrap right around my ear and feel snug.  This one takes a bit more work to get it to feel like it is on firmly, otherwise, when I move my head quickly, I can feel it moving off my ear.  I may switch out the older ear clip.For the most part, the headset works well.  It provides all the basic features, which many headsets (and couldn't we say smartphones these days?) fail to do.

However, this is one stylus that I feel is well worth its value. For less than 10 dollars the price of a standard meal in the US, you can purchase a stylus that will work for quite some time. The stylus itself has a pointer inside the silver metal lining. This increases the accuracy of the pen placing it with the very best. I sometimes wonder how New Trent was able to pull off such an amazing stylus. Furthermore, this stylus comes with a pen. The pen is one aspect that could be improved, especially holding it upside down it's just not very ergonomic. I would have loved to have the G2 ink instead, as that one is much more flowy and the ink comes quicker. However for those quick notes it's perfect. Overall I really like this stylus. I have tested it with phones, tablets and even the new Chromebook Pixel. It works just as good if not better than the finger.I cannot however compare with the Wacom pens, as I have yet to experience one firsthand, so as it stands this is the best stylus that I have ever used.

{"reviewerID": "A192GMTQ2TVISY", "asin": "B00EZ71LM0", "reviewerName": "AmeliaAT \"Apostrophistica\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I've been using this charger for a few months now, having received one for review in November '13, and I like it more now than when I first got it, which is often not the case.Superficial things that initially put me off: the gigantic logo on the back (which other reviewers have noted); the fact that it looks like a cell phone, for no good (functional) reason that I can think of, but isn't (it could have the same form factor without the glossy black side that looks like a phone's screen); the &#34;manual&#34; has absolutely no information at all about the use or functioning of the device, just promotional text.Those were all irritants, but once I began using the charger, they faded into inconsequentiality.First, I love that the device comes with its own usb cable (a short one), since sometimes I don't want to carry one of my regular long cables with me. Second, the included cable is flat, which means that it's very easy to &#34;spool&#34; up and it doesn't tangle in your pocket, bag, briefcase, or wherever you keep it. Third, because it is about the same dimensions as a typical smart phone, it slips easily into a pocket in my purse or my computer bag -- you could even carry it easily in a jacket or jeans pocket. Fourth, and perhaps most important, when it is fully charged, it can charge my Samsung phone from 20% to 100% and still have a lot of charge left for other devices. I've even charged my Kindle eReader using it. It is slower than charging the Kindle from the wall, but it works.As well as being convenient for travel -- even for everyday outings and running errands -- it is handy to have in the event of a power outage. I also have a larger external battery charger, but although it works well, it isn't nearly as convenient, since it is much heavier and about 6 times larger. I have a smaller, more flimsy external charger that charged ONCE, giving my phone only an extra 10% before it ran out of juice, and which thereafter did not recharge.It does take a full 7 or 8 hours to charge this battery charger after it's been depleted, but given how much charge it holds and how many hours devices (such as a phone or portable bluetooth speakers) can run off of this battery once it is charged, I don't see this as a drawback. I simply charge it overnight. If you need to have one ready at all times, you could get two of them and alternate which one is being charged.I have to say that while I found the huge logo and the glassy &#34;looks like a smartphone but isn't&#34; appearance somewhat off-putting, this battery charger functions extremely well. If I were shopping for one of these, its looks would have put me off; since I was given a sample and tested it over months, I found its size, capacity, and functionality more than made up for the off-putting logo and the manual-that-wasn't-a-manual (after all, what kind of directions do you need in order to plug one end of the usb cable into the charger and the other end into the charging device or recharger?), but the case and manual do need a redesign.I'd recommend this charger to anyone who needs a handy, pocket-sized but sturdy, high capacity charger and doesn't want to spend an arm and a leg on one.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great solution for charging on-the-go", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2014"}

With an internal TPU shock absorbing wrap around all sides and back your iPhone 5 is safer from corner and edge drops. I have not done side by side testing, just an intuitive feeling based on the shape and the material which has some give and bounce to absorb shocks. The polycarbonate midsection adds stiffness which helps lock the case on and gives a solid feel to what otherwise could be a squishy slippery case. All parts of the case are fingerprint resistant and easy to clean.The TOP wraps around the front and offers just enough of a lip to provide a small air gap if the phone is laid on a flat surface face down to protect from screen scratches.

I was disappointed even a cheap one wasn't included with this case.Volume buttons are the TPU material going through holes in the poly wrap and easy to press offering the same ease of use as no case at all.  Holes for mute, charge, headphones, camera/flash and speakers are all well proportioned so they don't interfere with operation and use of the phone.

Another reviewer (thanks Troy - crackberry_com) had mentioned that the Otterbox Commuter Case worked well with the Seidio Innocase Lock Holster for BlackBerry Bold 9700.  I can confirm these statements. It's almost as the Seidio Innocase Lock Holster for BlackBerry Bold 9700 was designed with the Otterbox Commuter Case in mind. It fits perfectly.With both the Otterbox Commuter Case and the Seidio Innocase Lock Holster for BlackBerry Bold 9700, I can access my mini-usb for charging, my headphone jack, volume rocker, my \"special\" buttons on the left and right and the lock and stand-by button at the top. Plus with the Otterbox Commuter Case, I can record video and takes pictures. The locking mech. works great with the case too. Nothing but good things to say about this combo.UPDATE:So, I've been using this setup now for like 2.5 months and it rocks.  I still stand behind my purchase and review.  I also read bad review for the screen protector not fitting right or not working right because of how the 9700's screen kinda drops at the sides but, I took my time and put it on and it looks great still, no air bubbles, nothing.  Maybe they updated their screen protector when I purchase MARCH 2010 who know.  But so far so good.  The Bold 9700 also has not disappointed and I'm loving that tether app.UPDATE:It now been 8 months as of 11/27/10 and can't complain.

Charme", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "I received this product at no cost from the manufacturer in exchange for writing a review. I really like this. Here's why.1. I own lots of electronic gizmos--iPhone 4S, iPad 3, Kindle paperwhite, Garmin 405 CX GPS watch, Jabra Play bluetooth receiver, etc.--so power banks have become a travel necessity for me. Typically I plug the power bank into an AC outlet so it is charging at the same time it is charging my gizmos. The problem is that most of my power banks have only 2 or 3 USB ports, so I need to bring multiple power banks. No more now that I have this product.2. This has a whopping 5 USB ports. What's more, they cover the whole charging range--.5A, 1A (two), 1.3A, 2.1A. Yet this is a very slim and compact unit: 3 11/16\" x 3 1/16\" x 1 1/16\". Plus it is attractive looking and has that \"Apple look.\"Note: A common misconception is that you cannot safely charge a device that requires only say .85 amp (like my Kindle Paperwhite) from a USB output with greater amps. You could use a 2.1 amp output to charge a Kindle if you wanted to; the Kindle would use only what it needs. Conversely, you could charge an iPad from the 1 amp output, but it would take a lot longer than from the 2.1 because an iPad needs more power to charge.3. This charges with a micro USB cable. Included are 8\" and 27\" USB cables with adapter holes onto which you can put the included mini USB, micro USB, and Apple tips. A fourth \"plug\" tip is included for other kinds of gadgets.4. There is a power button and four indicator lights to show you the status of the battery charge. I like that these four lights are each no bigger than the end of a thick paper clip, so in a darkened room they don't give off much light and also are easy to cover because they are spaced out only a total of 1/2 \".Bottom line: This is a sleek and attractive way to charge lots of gadgets at once without the need for multiple battery packs. With its 12600mAh rating, I have no problem charging multiple products at once. However, in order to avoid draining this quickly, I keep it connected to an AC power source.Update: August 21, 2013: With some battery packs the ports are always \"hot\", i.e. once you turn the battery pack on the power on the port stays on at all times, whether or not any item is in the port or is finished charging. So if, for example, you plug your iPhone in at night to charge, it's the same as plugging it into the wall via a USB AC charger.Other battery packs, including this one, shut the power off to the port even if the battery pack is on if nothing is being charged, or if an item is done being charged. This serves to conserve the power of the battery pack. So if, for example, you plug your iPhone in at night to charge, the USB port will no longer be \"hot\" (i.e. provide power) once your phone is fully charged.In addition, just plugging an item into the port will not start it charging. To make the port \"hot\" you have to press the power button on this pack, even if (as I do) you leave the pack on all the time and have it plugged into an AC USB plug.I discovered this the first time that I plugged my Kindle Paperwhite in to charge, and came back a couple of hours later only to discover that no charging had occurred even though the battery pack was powered on.

Wouldn't receive 3G or 4g signal of any discernible strength Foreign based tech support who couldn't answer simple questions. I live in the middle of a huge semi-urban coverage area for both types of networks.  Took two weeks (5 phone calls & 15 email exchanges) to get an RMA number for a product that wouldn't receive either a 3G or 4G signal out of the box on day one.  The kicker is that I signed up for their \"premium\" level of service and still had terrible service.  A customer only gets telephone technical support if you buy a premium or higher level service, but I've only been able to reach telephone support twice out of ten attempts over a period of two months.  No one answers the phone and there is no voice-mail option.  They finally sent me a new replacement device (after I paid shipping to return the failed one) which also diddn't work.  Since I couldn't get through using the \"premium\" telephone support I then tried email support.  It takes 3 days to get a response (at the earliest) and the tech support replies are maddeningly ineffective such as \"turn the device off and then turn it back on; update the firmware; hit the reset button, etc.\" All of these were tried in the three day period waiting for a response to my email request for technical support.Burying notices of significant credit card charges four pages deep in a user agreement and hiding links to customer support deep in the bowels of a web-site are strong indicators of outright unscrupulous conduct towards consumers.

The back edges have a silicone lips to keep the phone from sliding off a surface.

This product solves that problem by giving you a base right at your bedside where you can drop your phone to charge and pick it up when done. It also includes an extra battery which can be charged on the base and taken with you to charge your phones on the go (any micro USB or Apple connector phones).This is a much better design than the Duracell product from 2 years ago which had an ugly metal strip charging base and a bulky iPhone case. With a partnership with Powermat Duracell has come up with a sleeker design of the case and the charging base mat. They also added an extra battery which can charge iPhone on the go.The case is much sleeker and lower profile than before so it's actually usable this time round, however, like with many similar devices the Apple connector is inside of the case and the external connector is a micro USB. A special syncing cord is included to connect it to your computer for synchronization with iTunes. However, this adapter case makes it impossible to use your iPhone on music docks, on other charging docks that use the Apple connector. So you may have to constantly take it out of it's case if you use those devices. Also the case is a bit slippery, and not the prettiest case around but you have to live with it if you want to go wireless when charging.One other thing I found was that the case needs to be aligned correctly with the base to charge properly although it tells you with a chirp when it is correctly placed and then charged and lifted off. But if you're doing it in the dark as I often do you may not place it correctly and the phone will not charge.The on-the-go battery is a smart idea as not everyone may want to use the case, but may just want to use the on the go battery. However, if you just want an on-the-go battery there are cheaper products available that charge with a wall charger or even your computer. So at this price point unless you're using the iPhone case you may not be able to justify the cost of this system.It all depends on how you use your iPhone. In our home, we have several iPhones 4/4Ses, so this is a useful system for us simply because Apple power cords have a way of disappearing but the powermat stays in its place. However, like some other reviewers mentioned these products will be truly useful when Apple launches devices with integrated inductive charge batteries, so there is no need for an additional case.My Overall Rating = 3/5Design -> Powermat and Battery = 4/5, iPhone case =3/5Build quality given current competitive products -> 4/5Convenience -> Powermat and Battery = 4/5, iPhone charging with case = 2/5Charging time -> Approx. 2 hours with on-the-go battery, or a little less with the case and powermat = 5/5Price -> Given that it is not super-convenient to use the case and you may just go with the on-the-go battery = 3/5", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sleeker, better than earlier versions, but still not as useful unless you use iPhone case.", "unixReviewTime": 1344988800, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2012"}

I know lots of people write this in their review, but it's really true for me.  I started back when the first BT headsets came out.  First one I owned was a Sony Ericsson BT headset back in 2001 and I've gone through some great ones and horrible ones.  Best I ever had was the Plantronics 510 except for looking like a borg from star trek.  More recently I had the Blueant Q1 and settled there because I had spent so much on BT headsets.  After awhile I gave up on BT headsets completely and went back to a wired headset (Palm Pre headset).Well, I own a Motorola Photon 4G (sprint) phone and my headset jack just went out on me and I didn't want to bring it to the Sprint store so I bought this little nifty device (Samsung HS3000) not thinking it would really help me.  I need to use a headset at the gym for music and I'd like to have a good headset for talking on the phone in the car.  May I say, this item does NOT disappoint!  It is a really awesome device, probably one of the only BT headsets I've ever loved using.  Why is that?Things I love about it:*  It's sleek and clips on really well*  It pairs easily and stays connected whether you are listening to music or on the phone.  Nothing worse that when a BT headset loses connection.*  The mic is really good quality.  Let me emphasize that it is HARD to find a BT device with a good mic.  This is quality!  I had this little guy clipped onto my belt (MY BELT PEOPLE) and my friend heard me fine on the phone.  I've also tried recording myself to see how the mic sounds near my chest, at my hip, farther away to see how it was.  There are differences (quieter as it gets farther), but it's clear and you can still hear me.  Great noise cancellation.  I'm impressed!*  So cool to have the ability to talk and listen in stereo when on the phone*  Volume is great even with one earphone in my ear when I'm driving.  This is what really bugged me about other BT headsets - they aren't always loud enough when you need them to be.*  I can use this for skype, google hangout, audacity, etc.  Very cool!*  Sound is good for listening to music.  I'm not an audiophile but it fits the bill for listening to music at the gym.*  you can plug in any 3.5mm device - can you say wireless music to any speaker system?*  Loved the voice feedback for when it turns on, connects, and turns off.Things I don't like:*  The supplied earphones not so great, but eh, no biggie - we didn't buy this for the earphones, we bought it for the device transmitter.*  music buttons are a bit smallAnd that's it!  I'm really surprised I love it so much for what it is. I thought to myself \"Why would anyone need a bluetooth device that is semi-wired?

They all get the job done at various price points, but none of the designs really stand out... until now.The PBS Smart 5000mAh External Battery Pack Portable Power Bank Charger is unique in that it comes with a USB 2.0 to micro USB cable that conveniently fits on the edges of the battery (blue color in the photo).  The cable is thick, and stays securely in place as it connects to two ports on the top of the bank charger perfectly. (You must put the USB end in first to get the right fit.) The same two ports can be used to charge devices, or the bank charger.  Very smart design!The literature that ships with the battery pack indicates it can be charged via AC adapter.  The box I received did not have an included AC adapter, but the charger did ship with an attractive carrying pouch.  I'm sure I could use something like this: Zeimax (TM) Home Travel Wall AC Charger USB White for iPhone 5 iPad Mini iPod Touch 5th Gen to get the job done, if no USB port was handy on a charger or PC.My first attempt to charge this device was in one of my desktop PC's front USB 2.0 ports.  I couldn't get this to work as the USB/cable connection on the PBS's included cord was too big to fit.Eventually I did manage to get it to work on a charger I have with several USB ports that are widely spaced, but this may be an issue for others when using the included USB cable in tight spaces.  It charged itself very quickly and did the same for my iPod touch 5th *using a not-included lightning cable adapter and my iPhone 4S using the included 30-pin adapter and USB to micro USB cable.In addition to the included cable's cool fit, there's a hidden compartment on the battery that houses a 30-pin to micro USB connector. I'm not sure why the company didn't just put a 30-pin connector on the battery?  While this is a neat feature, the small adapter could get lost or fall out (seems secure now...), and then what?  As it stands, this adapter allows you to connect the included cable's USB end to the charger, then the micro USB end of the cable to the adapter and finally the 30-pin into an iPod or iPad with the 30-pin connection.A suggestion to PBS: It would be great to see a lightning connection adapter and/or port added to subsequent power banks, as that is Apple's new standard.The predicted life of this battery is equal to or less than 500 recharges.  The company has a Return/Exchange policy that's included with the User's Guide. They stand by their product and I applaud that, but I did have to laugh when I read: \"...Items must be returned with all original packaging and in new condition\".  What's the likelihood of that if the battery dies after a few uses and you've hauled it around in your school bag for a couple weeks?Overall, I really like this bank charger for it's innovative cable retaining design - one I've never seen before. While the inclusion of a 30-pin connector in the design is unique, the adapter could fall out or get lost, so it would be great to see future versions of this product with both 30-pin and lightning ports on the device instead of an adapter.I recommend this product to anyone looking for a compact, powerful, great looking portable power bank charger with features that are bound to spur other companies to step up their game.I give it 4 out of 5 stars (\"I like it\") because of the issues I had with a large USB/cable connection being unable to fit into a USB port on my PC, and the 30-pin adapter (while a smart design...) potentially getting lost or over time falling out of its compartment.NOTE: I was contacted by the maker of this portable power bank and asked to do an unbiased review for Amazon, in exchange for a sample product.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Innovative design makes it a winner", "unixReviewTime": 1380844800, "reviewTime": "10 4, 2013"}

The initial quality on the Anker is a bit better than the New Trent - the cables fit into the charging ports very snugly. The charging port is what failed on my New Trent so I'm very sensitive to that. The Anker also comes with an 18-month warranty, which is a big bonus over the New Trent. If you're comparing products from the two companies (Anker and New Trent) there really is no comparison - Anker actually has customer service and New Trent does not. I tried to contact them about the charging issue and they were nowhere to be found.I'll come back and update this review after I've had more time with the battery but my initial experience is very positive. It's a little bit bigger than my cellphone (Razr Maxx) but has the same form factor so it actually fits in my pocket with my phone, for charging in a pinch. The 10,000mAh capacity means I can recharge my phone at least three times without having to recharge the Anker. For anyone who travels and likes to use their phone or tablet on the plane, don't even think twice about it - buy it. For $30 you can have enough battery life to get your device from coast to coast with non-stop use.You can charge two devices at the same time (although you can't actually charge a device with it while the Astro3E itself is being charged).

It offers a nice balance between not being obscenely big, while at the same time, it's two part construction offers great protection.The inner silicone wraps around the phone first.  Its function is twofold: first, because it's what is in immediate contact with your phone, it's nice that it's soft, protecting from scuffs and scratches.  Secondly, when the case is completely assembled, it offers a fair degree of \"shock-absorption\" for falls from reasonable heights.  There are nicely fitted high quality rubber plugs for the USB and headphone jacks.  Button overlays for the power and volume rocker are easy to depress, and have a nice tactile \"click\" to them when everything is all assembled.The outer shell is a hard plastic which is mostly smooth, but does have a very subtle texture on the back.  Overall, it has a very nice feel to it.  It requires a bit of gentle maneuvering to get it to fit correctly over the silicone inner piece, but once on, everything fits nice and snugly.  Very nice fit and finish.  The cutouts are all very precise.  This is a very high-quality case.The main drawback is that there is a fair amount of bulk added to the phone with this case, making it difficult for me to carry in all situations.  Getting the phone in and out of dress pants or jeans pockets when it's in this case can be somewhat challenging.  Also, as others have mentioned, the inner silicone layer is a lint and dust magnet.  After having this case on my phone 24-7 for about a month, I ended up switching for a lower profile case which was more suited to my every day use.  I still turn to the Otterbox in certain situations, as the protection it provides is certainly second to none.A final word about the extended battery:The case will not fit correctly with the extended battery in the phone.  To me, having the extended battery was a must, so I looked into how I could have the best of both worlds.  There are a couple of ways around this.  1) You could put the phone in the case without the battery cover on, or 2) you could modify the standard battery cover so that it can accomodate the extended battery using a dremel tool (several guides on the internet if you Google it).  I opted for option #2, and with some careful dremeling, I was able to use the extended battery with the standard battery cover, and the phone perfectly fit in the Otterbox Commuter.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice balance of aesthetics and protection", "unixReviewTime": 1350172800, "reviewTime": "10 14, 2012"}

Well they have some very nice looking cases that are supposedly made from some high grade material but in reality are made from cardboard covered in faux italian leather. I own a few of Tridea wallet cases and they do not fair well over time (2 months). The faux leather begins to peel, color changes and the wallet/card slots are loosen to the point of not being able to hold cards firmly anymore.But wait this is supposed to be a review of CellTo so why am I talking about Tridea? Reason is because of the price. You may find Tridea cases priced from $20-$60+ while CellTo sales for $8 including shipping.  Also both cases do and advertise similar features.CellTo has what I think is same material used with  Tridea cases, looks appealing to the eye, and overall has a nice grip feel thanks to the ribbed design.There are two magnets, one in the front to cover the screen and one in the back so that the cover does not flap around when talking on the phone.The inside TPU bumper holder looks and fits very nicely. My samsung note 3 looks great in it and its very easy to remove if need to.The card slots need to stretch to break in so be a bit patient also maintain 1 or 2 card (preferably 1) so that bulging does not occur in the front. Try not to keep too many bills either because bulging will result.The magnets will interfere with the compass on your phone (its a magnet) but GPS works fine.Some people say that the S pen does not work where the magnets are located but it worked fine for meIts a pain to remove the S pen due to the deep groove but it just takes getting used to.The included screen protector actually surprised me and feels like a Spigen protector. It was slightly harder to install than Spigen but I got it to fit just right without bubbles.I modified my note 3 back plate with an Qi wireless charging receiver so that I may use my TLYT wireless charger and I was happy to learn that the phone charges with the case on.The case is not made of high quality and I do not expect it to last me too long (so far its doing great) but for the price you pay, it's hard to pass up.

Just know there are probably better (but more expensive) options out there.  If you're in the market for a decent matte finish protector and not too finicky about a few bubbles, though, I'd surely give this a try.

With several different ear gel sizes included, there should be one that fits your ears well enough. In a noisy environment, such as a gym, you won't have to blast up the volume as you would have to with the Sport. It won't shut out everything, but it's much better than the Jabra in this regard.Note, though, that the lowest volume when using it for phone calls with the iPhone 4 is still pretty loud. Not sure whose fault that is.Good sound across all ranges, with decent bass. Tried it with iPhone, iPad. Unfortunately with Garageband you can't do recording in real time, due to the Bluetooth lag, but playback is fine.Seems sufficiently workout-proof. The hydrophobic mesh seems to be holding out. We'll see ...Pairing is easy - it prompts for pairing each time it's powered on. Voice prompts for pairing, power on/off, etc.Mic for phone calls and voice control (if your phone has it); pretty good voice quality.Cons:The Power button is kind of a strange little nub. To press it, you'll have to get leverage against the other side of the battery thingy that goes behind your ear.The battery, etc. thingy that goes behind your ear is largish, and the connecting wire is kind of stiff and (when worn with eyeglasses, at least) seems to be a factor in making the earbuds less secure. I think it rubs on the neck or collar and slowly unseats the earbuds.The stem near where the eargels go into your ear are kind of big, so it's hard to get them into your ear further to block more sound.The case is a weird, flat thing with a strip of velcro in the middle, so it's kind of open on the sides.Misc:Battery life is 6 hours or more, depending on usage and volume.Uses multi-function button - one press for play/pause/answer call, two for next track, three for previous track, etc. Whether this is a pro or con depends on how much you want separate controls for these. Due to the size of these things, the multi-function button seems like a good tradeoff.UPDATE: After using these for a while, my chief complaint is the rather large earbuds, which cause my ear canal to ache after a bit. Another thing is the tendency of the cord to unseat the earbuds. I've changed the rating to 3 stars from 4.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Best bluetooth headphones?

I had a Jabra JX10 Bluetooth earpiece from years back but found that it was not loud enough to compete with the enhanced exhaust and 13\"-wide rear tires of my sports car.  Having been pleased with Jabra in the past, I naturally looked at their offerings first and decided upon the very reasonably priced SP200.The unit was as easy to pair with my phone (a Palm Pre) as any other Bluetooth headset and the volume is so loud that I can hear everyone just fine even if I'm roaring down the highway.  The noise canceling works so well that people often don't know I'm on Bluetooth and they never know that I'm in my loud sports car.  It's that good.A single charge lasts me several weeks (I don't talk that often while driving) and when it does get low, the handy LED reminder triggers me to drag it into my office with me and I simply attach it to the USB port on my computer (cable included) and let it charge for a couple of hours and I'm good to go again.Things I like about this headset:1) just tap the button and it wakes up from sleep mode and locks onto my phone2) have it paired with my wife's phone too (it can remember multiple phones)3) I don't have to turn it off- it magically goes to sleep after I've been away from the vehicle for awhile (15 minutes?)4) again, volume is ridiculously loud if you want it to be5) excellent clarity of my voice and their voice6) fairly stealthy up on the sunvisor- you forget it's there7) it's portable: sometimes I bring it in the house for conference calls8) crazy cheap for this level of qualityThings I don't like:1) I wish I didn't have to push anything to turn it on/wake it up.  Though I'm sure such a feature would be murderous on battery life.2) voice dial like my wife's car has would be awesome.

Previously I have had good results with two other Poweradd products I purchased, so I decided to try thisPoweradd LE011 5200mAh Power Bank with LED Flashlight.There are many cheaply-built power bank units with poor output regulation and inflated battery capacity ratings. That's why I conducted a test to measure the true capacity of this Poweradd unit.First, I made sure that the internal battery pack was fully discharged and recharged for several cycles. Next, I connected a 5-ohm power resistor as load to the USB port, and measured its output voltage and current over time. Here is what I have observed:- For the first one hour, the unit generated a very well-regulated 5.02V at 0.96A, or 4.8W of output power- After 70 minutes, however, the output voltage (hence power) starts to drop linearly with time. It dropped from 5V down to 4.75V over the next 100 minutes- Right after 172 minutes, the power cut off completely.(see the chart I uploaded to 'Customer Image' section for details)Based on the above data, I can estimate the internal battery capacity through energy calculation:- Average output power = 4.7W- Runtime = 172 minutes- Total output energy = 4.7*172/60=13.47Wh- Assuming conversion efficiency of 80%, input energy required = 18.84Wh- At 3.7V, the internal battery's capacity = 18.84/3.7 = 4.55AhTherefore my measured battery capacity is 4550mAh, or 88% of the advertised capacity. To put this capacity number in perspective: it is enough to recharge the 2100mAh battery in my Samsung Galaxy S3 for 1.5 times (since part of the energy is lost during conversions). By the way, my other two Poweradd products also show slight discrepancy between their measured and rated capacities:- ThePoweradd 2600mAh Ultra Slim Power Bank with Mini USB flashlighthas a measured capacity of 2490mAh, or 96% of rated value.- ThePoweradd 5000mAh Dual-Port External Backup Battery Packhas a measured capacity of 4380mAh, or 88% of rated value.The battery status indicator is very good. It uses 4 LED 'dots' to give a fairly accurate indication on the remaining battery capacity. Based on my observation:- 4 dots = 77-100% (approximately)- 3 dots = 57-76%- 2 dots = 39-56%- 1 dot  = 21-38%- 1 blinking dot = below 20%The LED flashlight, on the other hand, is very disappointing. The light is so dim that it is weaker than any of my keychain LED flashlights. In fact, the blue status indicator from the other 5000mAh Poweradd unit is about equally bright.Overall, I consider this Poweradd unit a good value (4-star). I would give it a 5 if the LED flashlight were a little more powerful.[Update on Oct 28, 2013]I tested thePowerBot PB5600 5600mAh Power Bankwhich is currently available at the same price. The PowerBot unit offers 10% higher capacity and a more usefull LED flashlight. The Poweradd unit still has the advantage of being more compact.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Adequate output regulation and battery capacity / Wimpy LED flashlight", "unixReviewTime": 1381968000, "reviewTime": "10 17, 2013"}

No complains here. I was also very surprised that the cables were quite well made - no exposed wires or loose caps ... nothing.

{"reviewerID": "AIFLY2HF8NS8U", "asin": "B0095P2F1S", "reviewerName": "Andre Lawrence", "helpful": [183, 194], "reviewText": "Update: Dec. 22, 2012Since I wrote this review, two (2) new stereo bluetooth headsets have hit the market: one by Jaybird (\"Bluebuds X\") and the Motorola (\"S11 Flex HD\").  An acquaintance bought the Bluebuds X, not wanting to wait for it to be sold on Amazon and was floored by the results.  I have the Motorola S11 and can tell you, it is better than these Jaybird Freedom Sprint.  TheMotorola S11-Flex HD Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Whitehas 5.5 hours of battery life, the comfort and the sound is impressive.  That's not to say that \"Freedom Sprint\" is not good, it is.  It's just that the battery life is VERY poor and the knobs are very small and delicate, but audio-wise, it's top-notch.I also need to mention that the Jabra Sport which I heralded for it's battery life is, most recently, not holding up a charge as it first did 18-months ago.  The ethical question I pose to myself with regard to the Jabra's is this:  Do I say that if you're considering buying the Jabra Sport that it only get about 3 hours before needing recharging (after having it 1.5 years) or do I leave the original comment that when new, the battery life is about 3.75 hours?So, concerning the Jabra's in regards to the newer models, if you buy them, the battery charge will decrease noticeably after about 1 year.Original review follows below:***  ***The Jaybird brand came highly recommended to me last year and after having them a few weeks, I know exactly why they're loved.  But, with a couple of minor and annoying issues, this is one terrific device.From a practical standpoint, there's really no good reason to keep spending money on inexpensive to moderately priced ($15- $65), wired headphones with the majority of bluetooth headsets approaching 4 hours of use time and the new Motorola (\"S11 Flex HD\") well over 5 hours.*** Design ***The Jaybird is a compact left and right headset with an enclosed microphone.On the right earpiece, you'll find the volume control/ track advance and mute button combo and on the opposite side is the micro usb to usb plug.  On top is a slightly raised and nearly invisible power button, which also serves to activate the Bluetooth pairing receiver.This is my greatest concern.Because it is compact and slimmer than the previous model, all of the functions are crammed into a smaller space.  After I had trouble connecting the device to my desktop, I called customer service in Salt Lake City for assistance.Having the power button only slight raised above the unit (not to mention, it takes holding down this button for 7 seconds before it's activated) means that this button will eventually - and long before its life expectancy--wear out.  If you need to pair a device, you're forced to turn off the device (another 7 seconds) then depress the same button again for 10 seconds: five gives you ten, the wear and tear of daily use will probably make you replace this, otherwise, stellar device within 1 year.Why not have separate and raised buttons placed on the left earpiece?  From an engineering standpoint, you can only reduce the size so much.*** Sound ***Fabulous.  Simply great.  Call reception was very good and that's considering that they were worn outside of a nippy and windy South Florida night, just days after Hurricane Sandy swept through.  And, the Jaybird's don't have a noise-cancelling mechanism built in.Streaming music from Amazon or iTunes or playing songs housed on my phone's SD card sounded crisp and full.  They were on par, sonically, with the garrulously-priced Sony (\"XBA-BT75\") and significantly better, in comfort, than theMotorola SF600 Wireless Sports Headphones - Retail Packaging - Blackand theJabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellow.*** Comfort ***The Jaybird offers you two (2) different ways to attach the earphones.  One is the standard earhooks.  Earhooks are a hit or miss proposition.  On some brands you don't know they're on; on others, your ears are throbbing within minutes.With the Jaybirds, they hook on to my small ears very nicely and they're definitely not intrusive.The second option is the ear wedge.  A cute design that is popular with Bose products.  The issue with the wedges is that they don't fit everyone (even with a selection of S-M-L) equally well.  Jaybird found the sweetspot with their design.I could use either comfortably, but I like the safety of the earhooks.Compared to the Sony's--The Jaybird's are much softer and fit snugly.The Sony's designSony XBA-BT75 - Balanced Armature Bluetooth Headsetis horrendous to hold: they're hard and intrusive to the ear canal.Compared to the Motorola, the Jaybird is just as snug.  The Motorola hugs the entire ear and simultaneously blocks out a lot of extraneous noises.  I'd give the Motorola a slight edge in comfort and safety.The Jabra is the lightest to carry in the ear canal and they're also comfortable.  But, the Jabra's work their way out of the ear after about 30 minutes and you're constantly re-adjusting thereafter.  Advantage: Jaybird.*** Battery life ***Charging time for the Jaybirds are two hours long.  Two hours.  It was one hour and fifteen minutes to charge the headphones out of the package and two hours subsequently.The tech support from Jaybird offered this explanation:  The Jaybird headsets use a stronger battery which takes longer on average to charge but they also last about a year longer than those found in the headsets of their competitors.I asked if it were practical to expect a customer to wait for 75- 90 minutes until their headsets were re-charged after about 3 hours of actual audio use?So you're essentially giving up longer use time and a longer re-charge time than the Sony's, Motorola's and Jabra's.  So, of the four wireless Bluetooth sets, this is the order of best battery life: Jabra's, Motorola's, Sony and Jaybird.  Advantage: Jabra.*** Price ***The Jaybird's are a new model and the $125 is typically the high end of what you'd pay for a decent headset, wireless or otherwise.  They're worth having even at this retail price, but it becomes a Must-Buy during the holiday sale season.It offers the best of the other wireless, Bluetooth headsets and it is less than half of what Sony demands for their set and you have a much better sound than the Sony's and in terms of call quality, comfort they're equal to the Motorolo's and the Jabra's.  So, even though the Jaybird's are roughly the same price as Motorola and about $50 more than the Jabra's, in terms of overall quality, the Jaybird's can't be beat.Pro's+ Sound reproduction is excellent.+ Call reception, very good considering no noise-isolating feature+ Comfortable and you have a choice of two different holders.+ Price vs. Quality--Very good buy.Con's- Battery life and charge time is deficient when compared to the competition.- Power button and Bluetooth access is cumbersome and should be re-designed.Overall, this is a very good quality device that allows to listen to music, have conversations, watch a Bluetooth-enabled device like Netflix without the burdens of a chord.  But, the battery life and design makes it an annoying oversight.So, better than 4 stars but not quite 5.  Since, Amazon doesn't allow for half stars, I have to choose between 4 and 5--the issue of design (which I have no doubt will result in early replacements and the weak battery life can't be overlooked.4 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Battle of the Big Dogs!

I really wanted to like this case after seeing it, but it falls short of my expectations.The problem I have with the case is the part that wraps around the screen. It's flimsy, and it doesn't clip to the phone in enough spots to actually keep it from moving around, like on the sides of the screen. Due to the lack of a rigid design in the screen part, it results in it not staying secured, and it is constantly pulling up the ZAGG Shield I have on the phone, even when I'm careful with it. Since ZAGG doesn't make a case friendly version for the Droid 3, my only options are to either remove the shield, which I will not, or remove the case from the screen, which then causes issues when putting it into the holster, which I constantly use. All they had to do was go for a Case-Mate like solid design for the screen part that was 1mm wider on the sides and it would be perfect. Getting it in and out of the holster could be a bit easier too if they just made the base of the holster a little narrower so you could use two fingers to push the phone out of it easier, but at least I know the phone is secure in there.It's really a shame, because I love the rest of the case. It fits the body of the phone great, has well designed cut outs for all ports and buttons, and feels great. I wasn't crazy about the angled ridges design at first but I appreciate it now because it gives it some grip. The holster itself is nice too. The clip hinge is metal and plenty tight, and the plastic clip has a hook on the bottom that will easily secure it to a 1.5\" belt and ensure that it stays put. It also swivels too if you're looking for that.I'm going to end up trying the Seidio SURFACE case too just to see how that compares, and if that fails, I'll just get the Case-Mate Barely There case and I'll just mix and match all three.

The actual mount itself is great. It can be attached to either your windshield or dashboard (I choose the latter), it can be adjusted very easily, it is literally a snap to put in or remove the phone with the easy release button on top, it can be oriented horizontal or vertical for the phone, and the phone automatically enters car mode when it connects and exits car mode upon disconnecting. Again, the mount itself is great.However, I have two major problems with the product as a whole. After only a couple months I noticed that one day I was driving and the mount just fell forward onto my dashboard and off the bottom adhesive. I put it back up but this is still a frequent problem and I typically have to reach up and push the mount down onto the adhesive as I start to see it lifting up slightly. I assume this is a heat problem, as it doesn't seem to be an issue when it's cloudy or at night; just when it's sunny and hot. So that is one problem. The other is that it is just impractical in the first place to mount on the windshield or dash if you live somewhere with a sun that comes out and actually plan on using the phone for navigation or anything that requires the screen to be on. The Droid heats up fairly quickly when its screen is on and the CPU is actively working (such as for navigation). If it is a sunny day, all the plastic in the mount absorbs the heat and transfers it right into the phone, increasing the heat by a lot. I have a battery meter app, and I have literally seen my phone sit in excess of 130 degrees on my dashboard on a hot day while I'm driving. Not only is this excessive heat bad, but it makes it impractical to use for navigation for a long period because the phone will not charge at that temperature, *even when plugged in* (try it and see). It will discharge and your battery will drop fairly quickly, putting you at risk for having a dead phone if you're not keeping an eye on its battery meter.The bottom line is that the mount itself works great. I think it is perfect the way it is. However, I hesitate to recommend it if you live in a sunny area because mounting your phone in plain sun exposure will cause it to heat up very quickly and by default cause the battery to discharge whether plugged in or not. If you live somewhere where the sun is hidden more than out, then you're in luck...but in a sunny area you may think twice before getting this kind of mount. An A/C vent mount may be better for keeping the phone cool and working efficiently, if you can find a good one.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great mount, poor mounting material and impractical in the sun", "unixReviewTime": 1288396800, "reviewTime": "10 30, 2010"}

The elastic still works great and I have had no worries about this product getting old and unsecure. I use it in landscape mode and the only time I ever had a problem was when I accidently yanked on my headphone cord...which pulled my phone out of the device at 70mph. Totally my own fault, and luckily the little 3.5mm connector holding the phone to my headphones was strong enough to not let my brand new phone fall to the ground.

If you're like me, you have multiple devices that you charge either daily or every other day.  Tablet, Phone, PDA, GPS, ect; it's just so hard to keep track of chargers, cables, and keep organized.  This charger changed that for me.One awesome feature of this charger is the four USB charging ports on the front.  The unit may seem like it will block outlets, however I find it to not be much of a problem in my home or while traveling.  This charger has two (2) 2A USB charging ports and two (2) 1A USB charging ports.  The 2A ports are great for tablets, and I have used it with my Nexus 7 with no problem.  The 1A ports are great for Smartphones or when you have more time to charge your tablet.  I generally charge my Smartphone with the 1A port and it charges really fast.In my case, this unit has now provided a central hub where I can keep all my devices together and charging at the same time.  There are no included cables with this unit, but you can use the USB charging cable that came with your tablet or smart phone with no problem.  I think this is a great product and it really provides a great charging solution for those who have too many gadgets to charge at the same time.  I have used all four ports on this charger at the same time and it worked beautifully.  I would thoroughly recommend this charger to the gadget obsessed.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

I have 2 young kids and am an avid camper so protecting my devices from sticky hands, dust and drops is more important than sleek looks.PROS-  The case offers good impact protection.-  The case seemed big at first but now seems normal after a week.-  Fits in the back pocket of my jeans - real jeans, not skinny ones.-  The case protrudes enough on front and back that it should protect your device if liquid were to be spilled around it.CONS- The screen protector kept sticking to the screen producing what others are calling a watermark effect.  It is horribly annoying.  I followed online suggestions to use Windex and newspaper to clean the phone and screen protector and it fixed the issue.  That said, the news paper/Windex did scratch-up the screen protector.  Lame.- I stuck the phone into the included belt clip and it started to tear the rubber casing on the phone.  Won't be using the clip anymore!- If you have really short finger nails than you may have trouble opening the flap to the phone silence button on the side. I have to use my keys.  The covers on the bottom are easier to flip open because of the speaker/mic holes.I think Otterbox could have done a better job on this case.  It's not bad if you absolutely need the protection but I recommend getting something else if you don't need your case to be bomb proof.I hope this review is useful to you.UPDATE 1/28/2013Otterbox is so nice to deal with.  They have sent me a new case and claim that they have resolved the \"watermark issue\" by applying a new material to their screen protector.  They also said that if you have an existing case to NOT use Windex or newspaper to get rid of the watermarking and to use baby powder instead.  They said to gently apply to screen of iPhone and to inside of screen protector - gently wipe away so you can't see anymore and then install the case. Also, the case really is very resistant to drops.UPDATE 1/31/2013Otterbox sent me a new case and the design has been slightly modified to prevent the water mark issue.  The good news is that there is no more water marks.  The bad news is that the built in screen protector no longer lays on the iPhone so there is a small air pocket between them.  It feels horrible.  Each time you press down on the screen you connect with the protector and then your finger must continue pushing down until it makes contact with the iPhone.  My wife said it \"wasn't horrible\" but i think it's pretty bad.

I had to spend about an hour with a small file removing the extra plastic so it could be assembled and rounding the edges so it would feel comfortable in my hand.The good: Nice and slim. Looks good. Slides in my pocket easily. Makes the phone a little easier to hold without dropping. I like the cutouts that allow access to actual phone buttons rather than having to push a bump on the cover like some models have.

It's relatively tiny, taking up the volume of a four inch cube, and has an attractive design that would be at home in an UFO.What sets this speaker apart from others on the market is the minimalist design. For one thing there are no volume controls - you do that from your phone or other device.The only real controls are the on/off button that will also put the device into pairing mode, and the call/answer button to answer calls on your phone. That feature requires that your phone be less than a foot from the speaker. That is why I mentioned that this is a personal speaker.Sound, in close proximity, is clear although a little light on bass. Still, it is rich sounding and not tinny like some tiny speakers I have tried. If you want something louder and richer sounding I suggest that you considerEasyAcc Bluetooth Speaker with Built-in microphone, which has a lot more volume (and controls for it), and a richer bass sound.Overall, this is perfect for me. I have it on my night stand to stream music from my Galaxy Note 3 to help me sleep.

This very cute Otterbox is the middle man that really is perfect for my needs.I have an IPhone for my work which means it is in and out of pockets, my purse, and my hands all day long.

Although this case does bulk up the phone a bit it still maintains a more streamline style when you consider the protection. I love that the hard case is on the outside because that plastic means I can pull it easily from pocket or purse. Of course that also means it is more slippery in the hand as well. I'm fine with sacrificing that for the overall functionality but please do note it IS slippery - so if you are a female that wears those jeans that only come to your hips with shallow pockets this case might be problematic as it is more likely to slide out.I found it easy to put on, the ports are all either uncovered or covered appropriately, and the color is mightily pleasing.

He used his iPad to buy one of these while we were out there camping!Unfortunately for my friend he couldn't use a coupon. But he told me the way this thing is built and as long as it lasts he'd gladly have paid twice the price.

With this lighter color (since I had black before), I do notice some extra nicks and little marks on the back plate, but better there than on my phone! I just really wish they offered one in red... (hint, hint Spigen...)  If you already have the Tough Armor case, these back plate frames are great if you like a little change every now and then.  Just don't mind some of those other colors, because they could definitely use a greater assortment of color choices...that's the only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great addition to a great case", "unixReviewTime": 1394496000, "reviewTime": "03 11, 2014"}

{"reviewerID": "A2HY1IGOK2MX5G", "asin": "B00A40BOBA", "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "helpful": [7, 7], "reviewText": "I've been doing the Android thing for years now. Been through a few manufacturers in that time. And the Samsung Galaxy Note II is, by far, the best phone I've ever had the privilege of using.First and foremost, the size. It's hard to talk about the Note II without mentioning its size. Based on the reviews I read on the web, I expected this thing to be enormous. Turns out it's really not nearly that big. It's amazingly thin, and a very comfortable size for my hands. Mind you, I do have somewhat large and clumsy hands. For my purposes, this is the perfect size for a phone. If anything, the Otterbox Defender case I put it in is what makes this phone appear really large. Without the case, most people don't really have anything negative to say about its size. Since I always have large pockets on my person (cargo pants, cargo shorts, jackets with large breast pockets, etc), I have no trouble accommodating this device no matter where I go.One drawback to the size is how ridiculous it looks holding it up to your face when you use it as a phone, especially with the Otterbox Defender case. For this reason, I got a Bluetooth earpiece (Motorola Elite Sliver) which interfaces perfectly with the phone and allows me to make and receive calls without taking the phone out of my pocket. I can also interact with the phone in various other ways via voice commands.Of course, the Note II's size brings us right into... the beautiful screen! What a fantastic screen. Best I've ever seen on a phone or handheld device. It's large, clear and colorful. In fact, it was so vibrant that I changed the screen mode to \"Natural\" to help mute some of the colors a bit. As a photographer, I can really appreciate this screen for reviewing pictures and doing some quick edits. It's the best compromise between a normal phone and an unwieldy tablet. It's also fantastic as a driving tool. Navigation is a dream to use on the large screen, and I can fit a ton of huge shortcuts on one home screen to safely interact with the phone while driving without ever taking my eyes off the road. In many cases, it's possible to use the tablet version of apps on this device for better functionality. For example, I use the SwiftKey Tablet keyboard rather than the phone version. This gives me a huge split keyboard in landscape mode, with room for arrow keys and other neat features, thereby making two-handed thumb-typing a joy. (note: the tablet version of Photoshop Touch is not available for the Note II, Adobe specifically blocks it. Only the Phone edition is officially available, which is a shame)Can you say fast? This thing is blazing fast. I've got well over 100 apps installed, with at least 30 running in the background at all times. I've got 17 active widgets on 6 home screens, all of which update with online data on a regular basis. The interface never misses a beat, and everything runs smooth as silk. I've run some pretty demanding games (Real Racing 3, Modern Combat 4, etc), and none of them needed any special treatment to run properly.With all those apps and widgets, I was worried battery life would become unbearably short. But that's not the case at all! If I'm using the phone constantly (which I often am), I can get a solid 8 hours out of it. Mind you, this is with constant use of data, heavy graphics, etc, all without ever plugging it in. If I'm just using the phone occasionally for communication tasks and checking updates (like a sane person), then I'm good for about 2 days on a single charge. None of my other Android phones ever lasted much more than a single work day on a charge, so this is a vast improvement.Another very unique aspect of the Note II is the S Pen. Some might dismiss this as a gimmick (I did at first). But after learning to use it efficiently, I now see the S Pen as a revolutionary way to use a phone! Taking notes is quick and easy, regardless of my current task. Using the S Pen to interface with the screen helps prevent the accumulation of dirt and oil on the surface. And swiping on the keyboard is much more precise. I can type quickly and efficiently with the S Pen in a way I never could with my fingers. As proof, I'm writing this review on my Galaxy Note II right now!Some will complain about the Samsung TouchWiz layer on top of the stock Android interface, and I guess they have a right to do so. Samsung imposes some frustrating limitations upon users. For example, the included music player is the default music player, and there's no simple way to change that, even if you have another one installed. If you use the call button on a Bluetooth earpiece, S Voice gets triggered, and again there's no simple way to change that. Then there's all the bloatware that comes pre-installed from both Samsung AND AT&T;, and most of it is complete garbage. Media Hub and Music Hub are useless memory drains that can't be disabled, S Suggest and S Voice are inferior alternatives to what's available on the Google Play Store and can't be removed, and the TouchWiz launcher is sorely lacking many features that can make the Home screens so much more useful.But the beauty of Android is that it's endlessly customizable! There ARE alternatives for all of those crappy included apps. And while I state above that some things can't be disabled or removed, that's not exactly true. If you're willing to root your Galaxy Note II, then the sky's the limit for customization. Rooting this device is unbelievably easy and opens the door to making the device truly your own. I've rooted mine. I'm still running the stock Samsung version of Android on my Note II, but I've gotten rid of all the unwanted bloatware, and replaced the built-in \"default\" apps with my preferred versions from the Google Play Store. My own music player, my own voice command interface, my own launcher, my own lock screen, all without any interference from the Samsung bloatware. No more Media Hub and Music Hub auto-scanning my device and running in the background every time I turn on the phone. In addition, rooting the Note II has allowed me to better secure my phone (Avast! Mobile Security works better on a rooted device, full system backups are now possible, etc). The Note II is a fantastic device as it comes from the factory, but it really becomes the perfect device once it's rooted.The only version of the Note II available from AT&T; is the 16GB edition (in gray and white). I was initially disappointed that the 32GB edition wasn't available, but it turns out that 16GB is more than enough for all my needs. With a 64GB SDXC card installed, there's plenty of room for all 100+ apps that I use, AND all the data they generate. I still have 9GB available on the phone and 35GB on the SDXC card (with over 30GB of music on the SDXC card). I also keep full system backups handy at all times. Turns out the 16GB of onboard flash memory are more than sufficient, and I had nothing to worry about.Have I heaped enough praise on this yet? But wait, there's more! The current official Android version for the Galaxy Note II is 4.1.2, which is a very recent version, even if it's not quite the latest. But apparently the upcoming version of Android (version 5, Key Lime Pie) is scheduled as an update in the near future! This device is getting a lot of attention from Samsung, they're not going to abandon it anytime soon, and that's great news for someone who's looking for a phone that will remain relevant for a while.Yes, it's an expensive phone. And it's larger than most phones. But this device has almost completely replaced my desktop as a daily computing device. It's the best portable computing device I've ever used, and I plan to keep it for a long, long time.

I did really like my last one, a Jawbone Icon, but that one was over twice the price of this Jabra, and broke into three pieces after I dropped it on a wood floor. So this Jabra is my replacement. After over a week of use I'm happy to have it. The pros outweigh the cons. My list of each is below, with only one real con from my perspective.Pros:1. Easy setup: My iPhone didn't even require the headset's passcode, it just connected automatically.2. Great Clarity: Jabra has always made good headsets and this is the clearest of the three or four Jabra devices I've owned.3. Battery: After a few uses battery life seems strong, I got a whole week of occasional use and standby time before I had to recharge it. Heavy use would probably require daily charging.4. Fit: The thin loop of wire that fits around the ear initially seemed far too loose, but it pivots in its fitting and therefore can be adjusted to fit snugly with a simple turn of the headset downward against your cheek. Additional rubber nubs for the inside of your ear and loops for the outside are included in the box (as is the charger, of course).Con:1. Voice Control (iPhone): Initially I was thrilled to notice that pressing the headset once activated my iPhone's Voice Control Feature. But then I realized that it almost never (only 1 out of 5 attempts) accurately recognized the actual voice command I was giving it. This was under reasonable usage conditions (driving at moderate speed, windows up, no music playing, etc.) This is unfortunate as I means I will still have to hold my iPhone directly up to my mouth to use the Voice Control feature.Overall this is a great bluetooth headset for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great headset for price", "unixReviewTime": 1291507200, "reviewTime": "12 5, 2010"}

It would be five stars if the included tools were just a tiny bit better, but if I could give 4.5 stars, I would be happy.  Couple of thoughts:- Make SURE to download or make your own sheet of paper with instructions on where everything should go.  There's no reason you should pay the $0.99 that a major repair company charges for this download, so use your powers of ingenuity and google \"iPhone 4 screen repair guide sheet.\"- Use some little piece of tape to tape down every single one of those grain-of-sand-sized screws, and number them in steps (see my picture for a suggested method).  While not necessary, the combo of aScotch PopUp Tape Handband Dispenser, 0.75 x 2 Inches, 75 Strips per Pad, 1 Pad per Pack (Colors May Vary) (96-G)and aSharpie Permanent Marker, Fine Point, Black, Pack of 5made for easier re-assembly.- The included phillips head screwdriver was adequate, but didn't hold a magnetic \"charge\" and seemed to strip the screws.  So I ran to the store and got theGeneral Tools 6 Piece Precision Screwdriver Set(for a *lot* cheaper than this price on Amazon).  THAT was a good idea.  I ran it along a strong magnet 20 times in the same direction to \"charge\" it up a little more (don't worry about it by the phone parts - you remove the motherboard and anyway, it's not very strong of a magnet).- Search for youtube videos and make sure you find one you like before starting.- The screen WILL fit perfectly flush with the phone and the home button, but you'll need to clean it properly of any itsy bitsy pieces of dust or glass to make sure AND pull the screen connectors through properly.  You'll know you pulled them both through correctly if they are exactly the same length (I had to disassemble it again to figure this out).Anyway, start-to-finish took me 2.5 hours and while it was a bit infuriating at times, it wasn't really a big deal.

Just gotta let it run out. Follow the instructions though, they are there for a reason. Other than the very first time you use this battery, it should not be charged unless it's at 5% or less. Otherwise you risk depleting the lifetime span of the battery. That's common sense though; even with the stock battery. I only charge it when it's down to 3%-ish or less.

The Amazon Basics case adds a tiny cleaning cloth, one screen protector (forget the plural in the product name), and a squeegee for application of the protector.PLEASE NOTE:  Amazon has combined product reviews for different Amazon Basics cases, some with screen protectors and some without. Also, different colors share the same reviews.  Customers should check the descriptions to see which version they are ordering.The Case: Four StarsFirst, the pros:  it has textured bars on the side for firm gripping; the case slips on easily; the cut-out for the rear camera is two-tiered, which protects the lens without casting a shadow over it; the silicone minimizes the possibility of the phone slipping out of your hand; controls are easy to reach; it's inexpensive and unobtrusive.The cons:  the case doesn't fit tightly; as I pull it out of my handbag pocket, the sides can get caught and can open up, thus becoming a lint catcher; the circular cut out in the back to display the Apple logo is unnecessary and perhaps will catch its share of dirt.The Screen Protector: Three StarsI've never used a screen protector for either one of my iPhones, but I figured that, since one came with the case, I'd give it a try.  Now I'm not so sure.  Make sure you use the squeegee (a small plastic tab) to apply.Pros:  it adds a protective layer over the \"gorilla glass\"; it does not impede the touch operation of the phone.Cons: you have to get the plastic lined up perfectly the first time; no matter how careful I was, I couldn't avoid two small areas with bubbles that I still can't get out; the iPhone glass is easier to get clean than the plastic protector surface; the sharp lines around the phone openings look and feel, well, less elegant than the original.If you really want a screen protector, then I'm sure this is as good as any other, but I have never had a problem with scratching either my 3G or my iPhone.Recommendation:  I would get this for the case and not the screen protector, unless you're going to buy a protector anyway.

These are my initial impressions, and I compare this to the Motorola H680 as overall about equal, very similar to the findings by a major consumer-oriented organization as to these two Bluetooths.I gave my used H680 away to a friend of mine because she was driving me crazy always speaking to me over her speaker phone while driving.  She used the speaker phone out of necessity because in California you can not put the phone to your ear while driving, and her bluetooth's battery had died.  My friend is not mechanically adept and I would've kept the H680 otherwise.  It is smaller and more convenient to use than this Plantronics, but I feel the sound quality with this unit is better.  This unit takes some adjustment so I hope the following comments will be of benefit to those of you who purchase this unit:1.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.2.  Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.3.  Once you have thoroughly read the instruction booklet (it's not lengthy) and you get past setting it for your left ear (if that is your desire), the only major thing to do is to determine which of the three eartips is best for you.  This is important for comfort and I suggest that you start with the smallest tip and work your way up.  I am using the smallest tip-it works best for me.Though the unit appears to be somewhat awkward looking, it really is not uncomfortable on the ear if you accustom yourself to placing the eartip comfortably in your ear first (contrary to the booklet and as if the unit did not contain the curved attachment)-the rest will follow.Sound is crisper than with the H680, and appears louder.You can't go wrong with either, but I think I like this one more.Update:  1/7/10  Sound is definitely better with this unit, and it appears to hold charge longer than H680.  Voyager is definitely larger than H680.  When you get past that, and realize the benefits of sound quality and longer use on a charge, you might favor, as I do, the Voyager 510.  It's quite enjoyable not to have to repeat myself when transmitting - no one on receiving end has complained about poor sound quality!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Initial impressions of this unit", "unixReviewTime": 1259712000, "reviewTime": "12 2, 2009"}

The BlueAnt Ribbon has paired perfectly with any of the devices I have used. My iPhone has been hassle free in syncing up. Very straight forward in terms of bluetooth pairing and those who have used bluetooth pairing capabilities in the past will get it right away. It's as simple as holding down the Play button for around 10 seconds until a traditional blue light blinks and gives you the go-ahead to turn on the device you want to pair with. That's pretty much it! I haven't had any sort of issues getting this paired or synced up.It's nice to have such a light-weight device that still allows you full control over switching up tracks and having the ability to adjust the volume with easy to manipulate corresponding plus and minus symbols. The device hooks easily onto your collar and this gives you perfect access to use the built-in microphone for hands-free calling...which I LOVE! This is such a great feature and the call quality is up to par with more expensive devices by Jabra, Plantronics, Motorola or Sony that I own. Voices come in crisp and clear and I haven't had any problems on that end.The ability to hook this up to my car is actually my favorite feature. I have yet to upgrade my only recently paid off Explorer and don't have any sort of fancy-schmancy touch-screen console to play music with and I have been making mix cd's for about 10 years now which has been annoying and cumbersome. I hate having to shuffle through discs! This makes it SO simple! I simply connect with my Auxiliary port and can play whatever playlists I want from my iphone through this device! I love this feature so much!The ear-buds that come with this are comfy and fit snug for me. I like that though. They aren't too wobbly or too tight. They are pretty much spot on for my normally picky ears. I usually loath earbuds and prefer wrap around headsets but these are decent. I am not planning on taking this set on jogs or anything like I will with my other headset devices so I am not going to worry too much about the buds falling out during rough activities.Overall, I really like this set. My only complaint would be the packaging. I received this and could actually feel the componants at the bottom section of the box just clanging around together. They weren't really secured in.

I've owned every Google vanilla phone since Google started with the Nexus One. This hardware with the latest OS is the first time I've felt really comfortable and ready to switch.

It's simple-- the edge of the phone has a really nice bevel to grip it. The Galaxy Nexus has a pretty smooth edge which requires you to &#34;cup it&#34; in your hand and sometimes use two hands is easiest. This phone has a nice bevel to keep it gripped in the hand so there is no issue holding it.From a performance perspective I should notice a marked increase from the Galaxy Nexus but I'll be honest-- this is not something I noticed. It may be that I simply didn't use in extreme ways to prove this difference.That all being said, in my opinion this is superior hardware experience to the Galaxy Nexus, but I wouldn't hesitate to go with the Galaxy Nexus if cost is an issue/focus.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "First or second favorite android", "unixReviewTime": 1358380800, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2013"}

It includes a USB cable that wraps around the device to eliminate the need for carrying a cable to connect the powerbank to the device you want to charge. I've seen that feature on a couple of other powerbanks, but PBS does it very well - the wrap-around design for the cable keeps in handy and also adds some visual interest to the powerbank.The wrap-around cable has a rubbery covering that appears very sturdy and able to withstand quite a bit of use. It snaps securely into a groove in the powerbank so it does not unfold when you don't want it to unfold. It can also be removed should you want to use your own cable.Additionally, the powerbank has an Apple-to-USB adapter that fits into a slot in the device and is held in place by the wrap-around cable. A great feature if you want to charge an Apple device - the adapter is there when you need it, and stows neatly when it's not being used.On the downside, it only has one USB output, and the size is a bit larger than other 5000mAh powerbanks. It measures about 2.25 side and 5 inches tall, which is notably larger than other powerbanks in it's power range. But, for me, the size is livable given the convenience of not having to remember to bring a cable.The case is white and glossy, and does show some fingerprints. The wrap-around cable is a nice shade of blue. While it's hard to call a powerbank \"attractive,\" this does look pretty nice.It also includes a decent cloth pouch with a drawstring, and comes very attractively packaged in a box with a foam insert.The 5000mAh rating means this is fine for phone or other small device charging. It's not the best choice for tablet recharging - you'd want to step up to at least a powerbank with an 8000+mAh rating for that.Well worth considering if you value convenience in a powerbank, and are willing to deal with a somewhat larger device to get that.[Sample provided for review]", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Convenient design for a powerbank", "unixReviewTime": 1380585600, "reviewTime": "10 1, 2013"}

The Go 2 doesn't stay in my ears and is on the large side for exercising, but it seemed like the best thing available last year.The Fit is disappointing in three ways: 1)  It's not loud enough, 2) the ear pieces hurt my ears due to their hardness, and 3) the phone functionality is the worst of the Plantronics I've had, and the call quality isn't very good with the other Plantronics headphones I mentioned above.1) Not loud enough -- The is a big problem.  I like to download movies to my Note 3 and watch them in the gym as I work out.  These movies typically play more quietly than other videos.  The Go 2 plays the movies just loud enough for me to hear and enjoy them in my noisy gym.  The Fit plays the very same movies just quietly enough that I can't hear them in the gym.  Music and other videos that play louder sound excellent.I have a speakerboost application that doesn't seem to make any difference to the Fit volume, but they have a feature that Plantronics should use.  Namely, they only boost to 60% unless you go into settings and allow them to boost more, which requires acknowledging that you are making this change.  If Plantronics is so worried about lawsuits if they make the headphones loud enough to hear in noisy places, they should use this feature to allow people to choose a higher volume.2)  The Fit doesn't fit --  The Fit earphones do stay in place no matter what I do.  I think it may also be possible to find positions for each ear that don't hurt, but so far, I have either failed to achieve that or I may have succeeded once.  They take me a lot of fiddling with them to try to find a position that won't hurt.Why it would have been so hard to make the earpieces softer is anyone's guess.3)  Call quality is bad -- I've made five calls with the Fit.  Three were so bad on both ends, it was almost pointless.  Two were good on both ends.  The three that were bad were with the same person, someone with whom I had spoken on the Go 2 as well.  On the Go 2, the other party sounded fine but complained about background noise.  With the Fit, both sides break up terribly and the person on other side hated the noise far worse than with the Go 2.It's nice to have earphones that stay in place--I bought a pair of wired earphones 7 years ago for under $5.00 that had an over-the-ear component that kept them in place, but they weren't waterproof.  It's nice that in 2014 Plantronics had the breakthrough of waterproof earphones that stay in place.  Now if I could only hear them without ear pain and make calls, they'd be perfect.  Perhaps Plantronics will resolve one of these issues next year and soak me for another $150, then resolve another one in the following year for, say, $180, and maybe they can do the last one in three years for, say, $210.UPDATE:  I exchanged my pair in hopes that my complaints were particular to the unit I received.  The connecting chord in back on the new one is slightly longer, within a margin of manufacturing error.  With the new one, I can get a more or less comfortable fit.

The only problem with it is Shure's coyness about how it works and why microphone placement is *absolutely crucial* when using it. Once you understand that, you understand everything you need to in order to want it more than you want anyone else's.The \"problem\" with the QuietSpot--mentioned by other reviewers here--is not a failure of engineering or quality control, but one of emphasis in their documentation. Barring an actual defective unit (which will usually not work at all) there is nothing wrong with the QuietSpot that proper adjustment doesn't totally eliminate. I believe that Shure doesn't tell you this for fear of alienating technically unsophisticated customers. Since I have nothing to sell you, I am blissfully unconcerned with boring you and can write something useful. Please note that I write this on the basis of a close examination of a working QuietSpot and an educated layman's knowledge.Observation tells me that, Shure's QuietSpot headset uses active noise cancellation and it is the only cellular headset on the market that does.  This means that the mouthpiece of the headset uses two microphones: one takes in the sound from the world around you while the second takes in the sound from your mouth.Using  a trick of wiring, this dual-microphone arrangement uses the sound from the outside world and uses it to weaken the sound from the microphone closer to our mouth. Since both microphones take in surrounding sound, the strongest sound that *isn't* cancelled out is your voice.For this to work, the microphones need very good alignment with your mouth. The  QuietSpot demands that you have the 'mouth-side' microphone pointed directly at your mouth, and the 'world side' microphone pointed directly outwards without mis-alignments like having the microphone-housing too far below or two far above the side of your mouth, or having the microphone housing turned on its side.The tough part about this is that the boom that holds the microphone can twist and bend while the QuietSpot is in your pocket or case, turning the microphone head around onto its side. If the microphone-head is turned on it's side, or set too far above or below your mouth, then both microphones pick up your voice with equal intensity and the arrangement does exactly as it's supposed to: It treats *your voice* like background-noise and sends everything you say off into oblivion.The solution is easy and useful: you have to learn to put the QuietSpot's microphone in the right place every time you put it on. Once you learn to do this with the windscreen on, you have what is close to the perfect headset. I have used the QuietSpot, standing in bars in New York City with the jukebox blasting and not had to raise my voice very far above an ordinary conversational volume and with the QuietSpot's noise-blocking earpiece, I could hear my listener perfectly. The two-way noise elimination of a well-adjusted QuietSpot is amazing, providing a sense of intimacy and privacy in conversations that no other headset ever gave me including one or two that cost more.The only other thing you need to know about the QuietSpot is that it is particularly sensitive to wind=noise and unless you intent to never use it outside, it is best to keep the windscreen permanently attached to the unit. You can do this with a needle and thread through the foam, or with a thin-strand of wire. Once you've done this, you'll have to learn to make the important adjustment by touch but even then, it's still easy.Now that you know all this, give the QuietSpot a try.

The package comes with the following: the 10400 mAh battery pack, two microUSB coiled cables, one battery pouch, and finally one multilingual user manual.The battery pack itself is self-explanatory. It has a battery status bar on the front with a button that once pushed, can indicate the level of battery charge. On its side, it has three USB ports. From left to right, you have (Out) 2A regular USB port, (In) microUSB port (for its charging purpose), and finally (Out) 1A regular USB port.The battery out of box, has over 75% of battery charged, so it is ready to use right away. However, in my case, I chose to charge the battery pack to full prior to first use, simply because that's how I use all my electronic devices for the very first time. To charge the battery pack, you can use your iPhone wall charger, connect both to the microUSB cable that comes with the battery pack.The first time charge can take quite a few hours for the battery to finish charging. Once charged, all four indicators will stop flashing and will all light up in blue colors.To charge up your device, you simply use the USB cables that come with your device. It works with lightning cable that comes with Apple iPhone 5, as well as the microUSB cable that comes with Google/LG Nexus 5. The two microUSB cables that come with the battery pack also work with Nexus 5 as expected.This is a great product when you are on the go, especially if you are not anywhere near a power outlet. Besides charging my phone devices, I also use it to charge up my FreedomPop 4G hotspot. So far the battery pack works as advertised, and I have yet to find any issues with it. It simply works! Highly recommended!Here are some additional information that may interest you. If you charge the battery pack, and at the same time want to charge your mobile device, it does seem to work with iPhone 5. It means that while you are charging the battery pack, your iPhone is also getting charged, regardless of which USB port it connects to (works for both 1A and 2A port). However, the same scenario does not work for a Nexus 5 phone. It means that while you are charging the battery pack, the pack in turn does not charge Nexus 5 at the same time.

OXA has a whole line of them and I've evaluated some others (as in the other cases, I received a sample for review). All of them are quite good if you understand how you're going to want to use them.Let's start with the basics. Input: 7800mAh, allowing for about 80% efficiency, should charge up in just under 10 hours. I found this unit charges in about 9 hours, a little better than expected and quite reasonable. Output: 7800mAh will give a typical tablet one full charge and a typical smartphone about 3 full charges. My results are in accord with this estimate. I was able to charge my phone about 2.5 times as well as charge an external speaker twice. This is about right. There are two USB output ports, one at 2A and the other at 1A. These are suitable for use in parallel and will charge your devices in a reasonable timeframe. (I don't believe in fast charging unless absolutely necessary; the heat generated can be damaging to both the device and the battery pack.)The unit is small, relatively light, and quite portable. It goes readily in a large pocket or easily in a briefcase, purse, or backpack. It is supplied with a cable and four adapters making it usable with just about any mainstream device. There is also a nice velvety carrying case. The unit has a small &#34;flashlight&#34; that doesn't put out much light but might help in a pinch.The 7800mAh rating places this unit between the larger (heavier, bulkier) 10000mAh and up battery packs, and the smaller (lighter, pocket/keychain size) chargers in the 2600mAh class. What unit you choose depends on your intended use. Do you want something small that will just &#34;top up&#34; your phone once or twice during a working day? Or do you want something that will provide a week of emergency power?This 7800mAh unit will provide emergency power for a phone for 4 to 5 days, from my testing. This makes it very good for camping trips and the like, and also useful at home during a power outage, even a somewhat extended one. If you're concerned only about home use and only an emergency power source, you might opt for a larger unit. But if you want something that will combine home and away use, including long-weekend recreational trips, this one is an excellent choice.I have no trouble giving the battery pack a five star rating.

You could take steel wool to a glass screen and not leave a single scratch.This is definitely the best case I have used so far on any phone.

If you want a real car-starter battery, you'll need to spend >$50 and buy a real battery pack with those large alligator clamps that hooks up to your car battery.THE REVIEW:The Jump Up Emergency Car Starter is a simple device that supposedly will jump start your car by connecting through your cigarette lighter. This may sound intriguing in concept, but in practice it just doesn't work if your battery is truly wound down.The device is a simple battery pack with a plug coming out of it that fits into the cigarette lighter.  When the switch is in the up position, the LED light goes on and the device powers up your car.  When the switch is in the down position, you can charge the Jump Up device while your car is running.All of this seems clever, but it just doesn't work in most cases.The first observation is that trying to power the car through batteries that connect through tiny wires doesn't allow for a lot of flow.  Voltage and current are two different things.  The battery has enough voltage to jump start your car, but it lacks enough current--or amperage--to do this effectively.The instructions tell you to plug in the battery and wait 10 minutes and try to start the car.  If that doesn't work, you need to wait another 10 minutes. Why 20 minutes to see if the thing works?  Because there is a tiny wire that connects the Jump Up battery to your cigarette lighter and some more tiny wires that connect your cigarette lighter to your car's battery.  No matter what the voltage of the Jump Up battery, the wires are too small to allow for quick flow of the electrons to charge your battery quickly or turn your starter motor.  Moreover, you are relying on the device to actually CHARGE your car battery.  With a standard jump, you actually just need to power up the car enough to allow you to trip the starter motor--you don't need to actually charge the car battery at all for a jump to work.  (Once your car is powered up, your alternator will generate power to charge the car battery.)If your battery is just on the cusp of dead (left the lights on while you spent a few hours in the mall), you might be okay.  But if your car battery is mostly dead (left the lights on overnight), you are probably out of luck.  There's not enough juice in this device to power up your battery enough to start the car.  And if the battery is truly dead, the Jump Up won't be able to transfer the charge to the battery such that the car battery can power your starter motor.If your car battery is mostly dead, all you are left with is enough power to effectively light up your car radio and even run it.  So if the kids are bored while you are waiting for AAA to jump start your car, the device may be effective for you.  Even so, you will still need something more powerful to get the job done correctly.In most cases, a reasonable set of standard jump cables would serve you better than this device.  If you really want to power up your car via an external battery, you'll have to invest in a much more expensive, larger battery--the ones with those big alligator clips that hook directly on to your car battery.It's possible that the Jump Up might help you in a pinch if your battery is only slightly dead, but it is unlikely to work in most cases.  I tried this device on my car--it failed.  The old standby jumper cables still worked wonders.It really would have been great if the Jump Up worked the way I wanted it to.  This is another one of those incredibly simple solutions that just doesn't work.  Sadly, I can't recommend this device.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Underpowered emergency starter--won't work if your battery is truly dead", "unixReviewTime": 1363564800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2013"}

Anker marketed this product for being \"one device for one family\" and they were spot on. The 5 port charger is not only portable, but most importantly useful. Rather than having 5 bricks that occupy so many wall outlets that are not so easy to find, Anker's 5 port wall charger is able to simplify the need into one convenient, portable, and light device.With using the device for several days now, I find it to do exactly like it says. All 5 ports work when connected with its included AC adapter flawlessly and my devices (iPhones/Tablets/Etc.) charge up to their normal speed. Everything just works - you plug in and your device begins to charge. Seamlessness is a quality that is exceptional within this charger.Another benefit that comes from using this product is the less clutter of wires. Prior to owning this amazing Anker Wall charger, I had wires going from so many places that it just looked terrible. After owning this Anker product, I am now much cleaner and organized when it comes to the cables and wires that are associated with using this product.The Anker wall charger can be used at home, in the office, in class, or nearly anywhere with an electrical outlet. It combines the need to have multiple bricks with a simplified and lasting solution. I recommend this product to anyone in the market! You will see a remarkable difference in the convenience and simplicity of using a 5 port wall charger from no other than, Anker.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Super Convenient and Useful!

It is common knowledge that we SHOULD NOT answer our cell phones while driving but it is inevitable that no matter what the situation is, we tend to answer our cell phones while driving. I guess this would be true for majority of us the reason why a lot of us now buy bluetooth headsets. Having a headset planted in our ears increases awareness and minimizes distraction compared to holding the phone by hand or pushing it against your shoulders.The Motorola 89556N Roadster 2 Universal Bluetooth In-car Speakerphone reinforces the \"safety measure\" when you drive and talk on your cell phone. Set up for this bluetooth device was the typical plug & play. It did not take long for my phone to scan & pair with this device. It is ready to be used once it is paired. Placing it on the sun visor of you vehicle assures maximum performance since talking will come naturally and the projection of your voice will be frontal or facing the bluetooth device where the speaker is also located just below the control panel. The 2-watt speaker with noise and echo cancellation proved to be crisp and clear. The person I was talking to heard me precisely. No jitters or background noise of sorts. Everything I said was heard and comprehended by the other person on the phone. The controls are easy to reach, call function buttons and indicator lights are on the front of the device--volume control, mute button and the call answer/terminate button. No fumbling when you need to press a control button which is very convenient. The power button is on the side of the device allowing you to turn if off when not in use but with a stand by time of 3 weeks and a talk time of 20 hours, you may intentionally \"forget\" to turn it off. Comes with the ultra convenient car charger so you can charge and use it while on the go. With a little bit of manipulation on the controls, this device is also capable of voice prompts for basic functions like battery status, muting and unmuting the device and call status. This convenient speakerphone also comes with an FM transmitter so you can stream music from your device and can now be integrated with an android app that you can download to your phone to serve as a car finder. Very cool indeed!Overall, very impressed with this device. Highly recommend this to further enhance your safety when talking on your phone while driving although common sense dictates that if your attention span is short or you are easily distracted, better NOT answer the phone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Driving safety is reinforced with some added perks", "unixReviewTime": 1334707200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2012"}

Lerch", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "The OXA 30000 mAh battery is designed to charge your laptop, tablet or cell phone. For phone charging, let's get something straight - 30000 mAh is probably MASSIVE overkill and you are spending money for something that you can use, but there are less expensive options available. To be clear, an iPhone 5s is something along the lines of a 1500 mAh battery. If you had 100% efficiency in charging (you don't - it's the nature of battery charging of ANY kind, not just OXA), you would have TWENTY recharge cycles for your phone. Let that sink in. For some people, that would be 20 full days of recharges. That's just... insane. If you want this for your phone, I hope it's because you will be doing some crazy travel, say the African Savannah where power isn't readily available. Otherwise this is overkill.Where this battery is NOT overkill, and where you are likely to get a fair amount of use from it, is for laptop or tablet charging. For an iPad Air, which sports an 8000+ mAh battery, you could easily get three full charges from the OXA 30000 mAh behemoth. That's a lot of recharges for a lot of time you can spend on your iPad. The other place this battery comes into its own is charging your laptop. The 30000 mAh is generally less than one full laptop charge, but if you are spending time on a plane or other travel and trying to work, and you routinely go longer than your laptop's battery can handle, you might just find this OXA battery can eke out the last remaining of hours you are spending on the plane with an active and live laptop. It's a life saver in these situations.Included in the box are adapters to plug into your laptop. There is one for Lenovo, HP, Dell, Asus, Acer, Toshiba and Sony. If you have a Samsung laptop, there are adapters available and I believe you could get one at a local Radio Shack if needed. This means you have everything you need in the box (assuming you have one of the supported models) to charge your battery during your travels.If you just want to charge a phone, be sure you have a real need for something of this capacity given the price. If you have the need for charging a laptop or tablet, then this device will likely be within your short list of things to purchase.
